	abstract = {? Abstract The stability of {mRNA} in prokaryotes depends on multiple factors and it has not yet been possible to describe the process of {mRNA} degradation in terms of a unique pathway. However, important advances have been made in the past 10 years with the characterization of the cis-acting {RNA} elements and the trans-acting cellular proteins that control {mRNA} decay. The trans-acting proteins are mainly four nucleases, two endo- ({RNase} E and {RNase} {III}) and two exonucleases ({PNPase} and {RNase} {II}), and poly(A) polymerase. {RNase} E and {PNPase} are found in a multienzyme complex called the degradosome. In addition to the host nucleases, phage T4 encodes a specific endonuclease called {RegB}. The cis-acting elements that protect {mRNA} from degradation are stable stem-loops at the 5' end of the transcript and terminators or {REP} sequences at their 3' end. The rate-limiting step in {mRNA} decay is usually an initial endonucleolytic cleavage that often occurs at the 5' extremity. This initial step is followed by directional 3' to 5' degradation by the two exonucleases. Several examples, reviewed here, indicate that {mRNA} degradation is an important step at which gene expression can be controlled. This regulation can be either global, as in the case of growth rate{\textendash}dependent control, or specific, in response to changes in the environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Protein synthesis by ribosomes takes place on a linear substrate but at non-uniform speeds. Transient pausing of ribosomes can affect a variety of co-translational processes, including protein targeting and folding1. These pauses are influenced by the sequence of the messenger {RNA}2. Thus, redundancy in the genetic code allows the same protein to be translated at different rates. However, our knowledge of both the position and the mechanism of translational pausing in vivo is highly limited. Here we present a genome-wide analysis of translational pausing in bacteria by ribosome profiling{\textemdash}deep sequencing of ribosome-protected {mRNA} fragments3, 4, 5. This approach enables the high-resolution measurement of ribosome density profiles along most transcripts at unperturbed, endogenous expression levels. Unexpectedly, we found that codons decoded by rare transfer {RNAs} do not lead to slow translation under nutrient-rich conditions. Instead, Shine{\textendash}Dalgarno-({SD})6-like features within coding sequences cause pervasive translational pausing. Using an orthogonal ribosome7, 8 possessing an altered anti-{SD} sequence, we show that pausing is due to hybridization between the {mRNA} and 16S ribosomal {RNA} of the translating ribosome. In protein-coding sequences, internal {SD} sequences are disfavoured, which leads to biased usage, avoiding codons and codon pairs that resemble canonical {SD} sites. Our results indicate that internal {SD}-like sequences are a major determinant of translation rates and a global driving force for the coding of bacterial genomes.},

	abstract = {Transcription by {RNA} polymerases is frequently interrupted by pauses. One mechanism of such pauses is backtracking, where the {RNA} polymerase translocates backward with respect to both the {DNA} template and the {RNA} transcript, without shortening the transcript. Backtracked {RNA} polymerases move in a diffusive fashion and can return to active transcription either by diffusive return to the position where backtracking was initiated or by cleaving the transcript. The latter process also provides a mechanism for proofreading. Here we present some exact results for a kinetic model of backtracking and analyse its impact on the speed and the accuracy of transcription. We show that proofreading through backtracking is different from the classical (Hopfield{\textendash}Ninio) scheme of kinetic proofreading. Our analysis also suggests that, in addition to contributing to the accuracy of transcription, backtracking may have a second effect: it attenuates the slow down of transcription that arises as a side effect of discriminating between correct and incorrect nucleotides based on the stepping rates.},

	abstract = {Local denaturation, the separation at specific sites of the two strands comprising the {DNA} double helix, is one of the most fundamental processes in biology, required to allow the base sequence to be read both in {DNA} transcription and in replication. In living organisms this process can be mediated by enzymes which regulate the amount of superhelical stress imposed on the {DNA}. We present a numerically exact technique for analyzing a model of denaturation in superhelically stressed {DNA}. This approach is capable of predicting the locations and extents of transition in circular superhelical {DNA} molecules of kilobase lengths and specified base pair sequences. It can also be used for closed loops of {DNA} which are typically found in vivo to be kilobases long. The analytic method consists of an integration over the {DNA} twist degrees of freedom followed by the introduction of auxiliary variables to decouple the remaining degrees of freedom, which allows the use of the transfer matrix method. The algorithm implementing our technique requires O(N2) operations and O(N) memory to analyze a {DNA} domain containing N base pairs. However, to analyze kilobase length {DNA} molecules it must be implemented in high precision floating point arithmetic. An accelerated algorithm is constructed by imposing an upper bound M on the number of base pairs that can simultaneously denature in a state. This accelerated algorithm requires O({MN}) operations, and has an analytically bounded error. Sample calculations show that it achieves high accuracy (greater than 15 decimal digits) with relatively small values of M (M{\textless}0.05N) for kilobase length molecules under physiologically relevant conditions. Calculations are performed on the superhelical {pBR}322 {DNA} sequence to test the accuracy of the method. With no free parameters in the model, the locations and extents of local denaturation predicted by this analysis are in quantitatively precise agreement with in vitro experimental measurements. Calculations performed on the fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene sequence from yeast show that this approach can also accurately treat in vivo denaturation.},

This results in dense traffic of {RNA} polymerases ({RNAP}). We developed a stochastic model, integrating results of single-molecule and quantitative in vivo studies of Escherichia coli, to evaluate the quantitative effect of pausing, termination, and antitermination ({AT}) on {rRNA} transcription. Our calculations reveal that in dense {RNAP} traffic, spontaneous pausing of {RNAP} can lead to severe {\textquotedblleft}traffic jams,{\textquotedblright} as manifested in the broad distribution of inter-{RNAP} distances and can be a major factor limiting transcription and hence growth. Our results suggest the suppression of these pauses by the ribosomal {AT} complex to be essential at fast growth. Moreover, unsuppressed pausing by even a few nonantiterminated {RNAPs} can already reduce transcription drastically under dense traffic. However, the termination factor Rho can remove the nonantiterminated {RNAPs} and restore fast transcription. The results thus suggest an intriguing role by Rho to enhance rather than attenuate {rRNA} transcription.

	abstract = {In Escherichia coli, expression of the {carAB} operon is subject to cumulative repression, which occurs by {ArgR}-mediated repression at a downstream promoter, P2, and by pyrimidine-mediated regulation at an upstream promoter, P1. In this study, we show that pyrimidine-mediated regulation occurs in part through a mechanism involving {UTP}-sensitive reiterative transcription (i.e., repetitive addition of U residues to the 3' end of a nascent transcript due to transcript-template slippage). In this case, reiterative transcription occurs at the end of a run of three T \{middle dot\} A base pairs in the initially transcribed region of the {carAB} P1 promoter. The sequence of this region is 5'-{GTTTGC} (nontemplate strand). In the proposed regulatory mechanism, increased intracellular levels of {UTP} promote reiterative transcription, which results in the synthesis of transcripts with the sequence {GUUUUn} (where n = 1 to {\textgreater}30). These transcripts are not extended downstream to include structural gene sequences. In contrast, lower levels of {UTP} enhance normal template-directed addition of a G residue at position 5 of the nascent transcript. This addition precludes reiterative transcription and permits normal transcript elongation capable of producing translatable {carAB} transcripts. Thus, {carAB} expression, which is necessary for pyrimidine nucleotide (and arginine) biosynthesis, increases in proportion to the cellular need for {UTP}. The proposed mechanism appears to function independently of a second pyrimidine-mediated control mechanism that involves the regulatory proteins {CarP} and integration host factor.},

When only ribosomal protein genes were used, whose expression levels are assumed to be similar, E.coli and S.cerevisiae showed significantly positive correlations. For the two eukaryotes, the distribution of effective number of codons was different in short genes (300{\textendash}500 bp) compared with longer genes; this was not observed in E.coli. Both positive and negative correlations can be explained by translational selection. Energetically costly longer genes have higher codon usage bias to maximize translational efficiency. Selection may also be acting to reduce the size of highly expressed proteins, and the effect is particularly pronounced in eukaryotes. The different relationships between codon usage bias and gene length observed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes may be the consequence of these different types of selection.},

	abstract = {Synonymous mutations are mutations that change the nucleotide sequence of a gene without changing the amino-acid sequence. Because these mutations don't alter the expressed protein, they are frequently also called silent mutations. Yet increasing evidence demonstrates that synonymous mutations are not that silent. In particular, experimental work in Escherichia coli has shown that the choice of synonymous codons near the start codon can greatly influence protein production. Codons that allow the {mRNA} to fold into a stable secondary structure seem to inhibit efficient translation initiation. This observation suggests that selection should prefer reduced {mRNA} stability near the start codon in many organisms. Here, we show that this prediction generally holds true in most organisms, including bacteria, archaea, fungi, plants, insects, and fishes. In birds and mammals it doesn't hold true genome-wide, but it does hold true in the most {GC}-rich genes. In all organisms, the extent to which {mRNA} stability is reduced increases with increasing {GC} content. In prokaryotes, it also increases with decreasing optimal growing temperature. Thus, it seems that all organisms have to optimize their synonymous sites near the start codon to guarantee efficient protein translation.},

	abstract = {Although the first poly(A) polymerase ({PAP}) was discovered in Escherichia coli in 1962, the study of polyadenylation in bacteria was largely ignored for the next 30 years. However, with the identification of the structural gene for E. coli {PAP} I in 1992, it became possible to analyze polyadenylation using both biochemical and genetic approaches. Subsequently, it has been shown that polyadenylation plays a multifunctional role in prokaryotic {RNA} metabolism. Although the bulk of our current understanding of prokaryotic polyadenylation comes from studies on E. coli, recent limited experiments with Cyanobacteria, organelles, and Archaea have widened our view on the diversity, complexity, and universality of the polyadenylation process. For example, the identification of polynucleotide phosphorylase ({PNPase}), a reversible phosphorolytic enzyme that is highly conserved in bacteria, as an additional {PAP} in E. coli caught everyone by surprise. In fact, {PNPase} has now been shown to be the source of post-transcriptional {RNA} modifications in a wide range of cells of prokaryotic origin including those that lack a eubacterial {PAP} homolog. Accordingly, the past few years have witnessed increased interest in the mechanism and role of post-transcriptional modifications in all species of prokaryotic origin. However, the fact that many of the poly(A) tails are very short and unstable as well as the presence of polynucleotide tails has posed significant technical challenges to the scientific community trying to unravel the mystery of polyadenylation in prokaryotes. This review discusses the current state of knowledge regarding polyadenylation and its functions in bacteria, organelles, and Archaea. {WIREs} {RNA} 2011 2 256{\textendash}276 {DOI}: 10.1002/wrna.51},

In this study, we use a single-molecule transcription assay to investigate the effect of template base-pair composition on pausing by {RNA} polymerase {II} and the evolutionarily distinct mitochondrial polymerase Rpo41. For both enzymes, pauses are shorter and less frequent on {GC}-rich templates. Significantly, incubation with {RNase} abolishes the template dependence of pausing. A kinetic model, wherein the secondary structure of the nascent {RNA} poses an energetic barrier to pausing by impeding backtracking along the template, quantitatively predicts the pause densities and durations observed. The energy barriers extracted from the data correlate well with {RNA} folding energies obtained from cotranscriptional folding simulations. These results reveal that {RNA} secondary structures provide a cis-acting mechanism by which sequence modulates transcriptional elongation.},

	abstract = {Messenger {RNAs} in prokaryotes exhibit short half-lives when compared with eukaryotic {mRNAs}. Considerable progress has been made during recent years in our understanding of {mRNA} degradation in bacteria. Two major aspects determine the life span of a messenger in the bacterial cell. On the side of the substrate, the structural features of {mRNA} have a profound influence on the stability of the molecule. On the other hand, there is the degradative machinery. Progress in the biochemical characterization of proteins involved in {mRNA} degradation has made clear that {RNA} degradation is a highly organized cellular process in which several protein components, and not only nucleases, are involved. In Escherichia coli, these proteins are organized in a high molecular mass complex, the degradosome. The key enzyme for initial events in {mRNA} degradation and for the assembly of the degradosome is endoribonuclease E. We discuss the identified components of the degradosome and its mode of action. Since research in {mRNA} degradation suffers from dominance of E. coli-related observations we also look to other organisms to ask whether they could possibly follow the E. coli standard model.},

	abstract = {Transcription elongation consists of repetition of the nucleotide addition cycle: phosphodiester bond formation, translocation and binding of the next nucleotide. Inhibitor of multi-subunit {RNA} polymerase tagetitoxin ({TGT}) enigmatically slows down addition of nucleotides in a sequence-dependent manner, only at certain positions of the template. Here, we show that {TGT} neither affects chemistry of {RNA} synthesis nor induces backward translocation, nor competes with the nucleoside triphosphate ({NTP}) in the active center. Instead, {TGT} increases the stability of the pre-translocated state of elongation complex, thus slowing down addition of the following nucleotide. We show that the extent of inhibition directly depends on the intrinsic stability of the pre-translocated state. The dependence of translocation equilibrium on the transcribed sequence results in a wide distribution (\~{}1{\textendash}103-fold) of inhibitory effects of {TGT} at different positions of the template, thus explaining sequence-specificity of {TGT} action. We provide biochemical evidence that, in pre-translocated state, {TGT} stabilizes folded conformation of the Trigger Loop, which inhibits forward and backward translocation of the complex. The results suggest that Trigger Loop folding in the pre-translocated state may serve to reduce backtracking of the elongation complex. Overall, we propose that translocation may be a limiting and highly regulated step of {RNA} synthesis.},

In order to achieve this, we study the known primary and secondary structures of a comprehensive data set of 361 {RNA} genes as well as a set of 48 {RNA} sequences that are known to differ from the originally transcribed sequence units. We detect co-transcriptional folding by defining two measures of directedness which quantify the extend of asymmetry between alternative helices that lie 5' and those that lie 3' of the known helices with which they compete.{RESULTS}:We show with statistical significance that co-transcriptional folding strongly influences {RNA} sequences in two ways: (1) alternative helices that would compete with the formation of the functional structure during co-transcriptional folding are suppressed and (2) the formation of transient structures which may serve as guidelines for the co-transcriptional folding pathway is encouraged.{CONCLUSIONS}:These findings have a number of implications for {RNA} secondary structure prediction methods and the detection of {RNA} genes.},

This observation suggests that a metric of relative {mRNA} secondary-structure stability, {Z$\Delta$G}, could be used to test whether putative genes are likely to be functionally important. Using the Escherichia coli genome, we compared the mean {Z$\Delta$G} of genes with known functions, genes with known orthologs, genes where function and orthology are unknown, and pseudogenes. Genes in the first two categories demonstrated similar levels of selection for reduced stability (increased {Z$\Delta$G}), whereas for pseudogenes stability did not differ from our null expectation. Surprisingly, genes where function and orthology were unknown were also not different from the null expectation, suggesting that many of these open reading frames are not functionally important. We extended our analysis by constructing a Bayesian phylogenetic mixed model based on data from 145 prokaryotic genomes. As in E. coli, genes with no known function had consistently lower {Z$\Delta$G}, even though we expect that many of the currently unannotated genes will ultimately have their functional utility discovered. Our findings suggest that functional genes tend to evolve increased {Z$\Delta$G}, whereas nonfunctional ones do not. Therefore, {Z$\Delta$G} may be a useful metric for identifying genes of potentially important function and could be used to target genes for further functional study.},

Translation initiation is a key step for regulating the level of numerous proteins within the cell. In bacteria, the 30S initiation complex directly binds to the translation initiation region ({TIR}) of the {mRNA}. How the ribosomal 30S subunit assembles on highly structured {TIR} is not known. Using fluorescence-based experiments, we assayed 12 different {mRNAs} that form secondary structures with various stabilities and contain Shine-Dalgarno ({SD}) sequences of different strengths. A strong correlation was observed between the stability of the {mRNA} structure and the association and dissociation rate constants. Interestingly, in the presence of initiation factors and initiator {tRNA}, the association kinetics of structured {mRNAs} showed two distinct phases. The second phase was found to be important for unfolding structured {mRNAs} to form a stable 30S initiation complex. We show that unfolding of structured {mRNAs} requires a {SD} sequence, the start codon, {fMet}-{tRNAfMet}, and the {GTP} bound form of initiation factor 2 bound to the 30S subunit.},

All mutations in the libraries are located at least 8~bp downstream of the transcriptional start site. The libraries were screened using the ampicillin-resistance gene (bla) as reporter, allowing easy identification of {UTR} mutants that display high levels of expression (up to 20-fold increase relative to the wild-type at the protein level). Studies of the two {UTR} mutants identified by a modified screening procedure showed that their expression is stimulated to a similar extent at both the transcript and protein product levels. For one such mutant a model analysis of the transcription kinetics showed significant evidence of a difference in the transcription rate (about 18-fold higher than the wild type), while there was no evidence of a difference in transcript stability. The two {UTR} sequences also stimulated expression from a constitutive 03C370-dependent promoter (P1/Panti-tet), demonstrating that the {UTR} at the {DNA} or {RNA} level has a hitherto unrecognized role in transcription.},

Whereas an increased homology score correlates with higher rates of {RNA} polymerase binding, it does not correlate with activity in vivo. Permanganate probing in vivo reveals that {PS}1, which exhibits the lowest homology score, is rate-limited during the early phase of promoter-{RNA} polymerase interactions. By contrast, {PS}2 and {PS}3, with higher homology scores, are limited at a late step involving an open {DNA} region spanning from +6 to +12, indicating a stalling of {RNA} polymerase. These complexes disappear upon treatment of cells with rifampicin and are replaced by open complexes covering the start site. Because initiated complexes are selectively insensitive to rifampicin action, this confirms that {RNA} polymerase stalled at +6 to +12 has initiated {RNA} synthesis. Kinetic studies indicate that the enzyme is released slowly from this position and that this slow release appears to be responsible for the low promoter activity. For {PS}3, which exhibits the highest homology score and which binds {RNA} polymerase most efficiently, the release of the stalled complex is particularly slow. {PS}3 is found to be the weakest of the three promoters in vivo. These results support models in which promoter activity can be determined by various rate limiting steps, including those following the formation of open complexes and even the initiation of {RNA} synthesis.},

We show here that this sequence does not function with even the strongest $\varsigma$32 promoter. Moreover, a particular class of substitutions in $\varsigma$70 that disrupt interaction between Region 2.2 of $\varsigma$70 and a coiled-coiled motif in the $\beta$'-subunit of {RNA} polymerase antagonizes the function of the anti-element. This same group of mutants prevents $\lambda$Q-mediated anti-termination at the $\lambda${PR}' promoter. At this promoter, interaction of $\varsigma$70 with the non-template strand of the initial transcribed sequence ({ITS}) is required to promote the pause prerequisite for anti-termination. These mutants prevent pausing because they are defective in this recognition event. By analogy, we suggest that interaction of $\varsigma$70 with the non-template strand of the anti-{ITS} is required for function of this portable element, thus explaining why neither $\varsigma$32 nor the Region 2.2 $\varsigma$70 mutants mediate anti-function. Support for the analogy with the $\lambda${PR}' promoter comes from preliminary experiments suggesting that the anti-{ITS}, like the $\lambda${PR}'{ITS}, is bipartite.},

	abstract = {Translational efficiency in Escherichia coli is in part determined by the Shine-Dalgarno ({SD}) interaction, i.e. the base-pairing of the 3' end of 16 S ribosomal {RNA} to a stretch of complementary nucleotides in the messenger, located just upstream of the initiation codon. Although a large number of mutations in {SD} sequences have been produced and analysed, it has so far not been possible to find a clear-cut quantitative relationship between the extent of the complementarity to the {rRNA} and translational efficiency. This is presumably due to a lack of information about the secondary structures of the messengers used, before and after mutagenesis. Such information is crucial, because intrastrand base-pairing of a ribosome binding site can have a profound influence on its translational efficiency.

By site-directed mutagenesis, we have varied the extent of the {SD} complementarity in the coat-protein gene of bacteriophage {MS}2. The ribosome binding site of this gene is known to adopt a simple hairpin structure. Substitutions in the {SD} region were combined with other mutations, which altered the stability of the structure in a predictable way. We find that mutations reducing the {SD} complementarity by one or two nucleotides diminish translational efficiency only if ribosome binding is impaired by the structure of the messenger. In the absence of an inhibitory structure, these mutations have no effect. In other words, a strong {SD} interaction can compensate for a structured initiation region. This can be understood by considering translational initiation on a structured ribosome binding site as a competition between intramolecular base-pairing of the messenger and binding to a 30 S ribosomal subunit. A good {SD} complementarity provides the ribosome with an increased affinity for its binding site, and thereby enhances its ability to compete against the secondary structure. This function of the {SD} interaction closely parallels the {RNA}-unfolding capacity of ribosomal protein S1.

By comparing the expression data from mutant and wild-type {SD} sequences, we have estimated the relative contribution of the {SD} base-pairs to ribosome-{mRNA} affinity. Quantitatively, this contribution corresponds quite well with the theoretical base-pairing stabilities of the wild-type and mutant {SD} interactions.},

	abstract = {Local denaturation, the separation at specific sites of the two strands comprising the {DNA} double helix, is one of the most fundamental processes in biology, required to allow the base sequence to be read both in {DNA} transcription and in replication. In living organisms this process can be mediated by enzymes which regulate the amount of superhelical stress imposed on the {DNA}. We present a numerically exact technique for analyzing a model of denaturation in superhelically stressed {DNA}. This approach is capable of predicting the locations and extents of transition in circular superhelical {DNA} molecules of kilobase lengths and specified base pair sequences. It can also be used for closed loops of {DNA} which are typically found in vivo to be kilobases long. The analytic method consists of an integration over the {DNA} twist degrees of freedom followed by the introduction of auxiliary variables to decouple the remaining degrees of freedom, which allows the use of the transfer matrix method. The algorithm implementing our technique requires O(N2) operations and O(N) memory to analyze a {DNA} domain containing N base pairs. However, to analyze kilobase length {DNA} molecules it must be implemented in high precision floating point arithmetic. An accelerated algorithm is constructed by imposing an upper bound M on the number of base pairs that can simultaneously denature in a state. This accelerated algorithm requires O({MN}) operations, and has an analytically bounded error. Sample calculations show that it achieves high accuracy (greater than 15 decimal digits) with relatively small values of M (M{\textless}0.05N) for kilobase length molecules under physiologically relevant conditions. Calculations are performed on the superhelical {pBR}322 {DNA} sequence to test the accuracy of the method. With no free parameters in the model, the locations and extents of local denaturation predicted by this analysis are in quantitatively precise agreement with in vitro experimental measurements. Calculations performed on the fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene sequence from yeast show that this approach can also accurately treat in vivo denaturation.},

We show that folding of the hairpin disrupts the three upstream base pairs of the 8 bp {RNA}:{DNA} hybrid, a major stability determinant in the complex. Shortening the weak {rU}:{dA} hybrid from 8 nt to 5 nt causes dissociation of the complex. During termination, the hairpin does not directly compete for base pairing with the 8 bp hybrid. Thus, melting of the hybrid seems to result from spatial restrictions in {RNA} polymerase that couple the hairpin formation with the disruption of the hybrid immediately downstream from the stem. Our results suggest that a similar mechanism disrupts elongation complexes of yeast {RNA} polymerase {II} in vitro.},

The gene also activates the transcription of the same operon in the presence of m-xylene or m-methylbenzyl alcohol, but for this activation another regulatory gene, {xylR}, is required. In this study we examined the {xylS} expression by determining the {mRNA} by reverse transcriptase mapping and by monitoring the enzyme activity of the {xylE} gene product, which was expressed under the control of the {xylS} promoter. The results of the above experiments provide evidence that {xylR} positively controls the transcription of {xylS} in the presence of m-xylene or m-methylbenzyl alcohol. The {xylS} product thus amplified may in turn activate the {xylDLEGF} operon. The nucleotide sequence of the {xylS} promoter resembles that of the promoter of the {xylCAB} operon for the m-xylene-degrading pathway, which is also activated by {xylR} in the presence of m-xylene or m-methylbenzyl alcohol. In addition, we have demonstrated that the expression of {xylR} is negatively controlled by its own product. On the basis of these findings, we propose a revised model for the regulation of expression of xyl genes on the {TOL} plasmid.},

	abstract = {The maturation or A-protein gene of single-stranded {RNA} phage {MS}2 is preceded by a 130-nt long untranslated leader. When {MS}2 {RNA} folding is at equilibrium, the gene is untranslatable because the leader adopts a well-defined cloverleaf structure in which the Shine-Dalgarno ({SD}) sequence of the maturation gene is taken up in long-distance base pairing with an upstream complementary sequence ({UCS}). Synthesis of the A-protein takes place transiently while the {RNA} is synthesized from the minus strand. This requires that formation of the inhibitory cloverleaf is slow. In vitro, the folding delay was on the order of minutes. Here, we present evidence that this postponed folding is caused by the formation of a metastable intermediate. This intermediate is a small local hairpin that contains the {UCS} in its loop, thereby preventing or slowing down its pairing with the {SD} sequence. Mutants in which the small hairpin could not be formed made no detectable amounts of A-protein and were barely viable. Apparently, here the cloverleaf formed quicker than ribosomes could bind. On the other hand, mutants in which the small intermediary hairpin was stabilized produced more A-protein than wild type and were viable. One hardly growing mutant that could not form the metastable hairpin and did not make detectable amounts of A-protein was evolved. The emerging pseudo-revertant had selected two second site repressor mutations that allowed reconstruction of a variant of the metastable intermediate. The pseudo-revertant had also regained the capacity to produce the A-protein.},

	abstract = {Highly expressed genes in many bacteria and small eukaryotes often have a strong compositional bias, in terms of codon usage. Two widely used numerical indices, the codon adaptation index ({CAI}) and the codon usage, use this bias to predict the expression level of genes. When these indices were first introduced, they were based on fairly simple assumptions about which genes are most highly expressed: the {CAI} was originally based on the codon composition of a set of only 24 highly expressed genes, and the codon usage on assumptions about which functional classes of genes are highly expressed in fast-growing bacteria. Given the recent advent of genome-wide expression data, we should be able to improve on these assumptions. Here, we measure, in yeast, the degree to which consideration of the current genome-wide expression data sets improves the performance of both numerical indices. Indeed, we find that by changing the parameterization of each model its correlation with actual expression levels can be somewhat improved, although both indices are fairly insensitive to the exact way they are parameterized. This insensitivity indicates a consistent codon bias amongst highly expressed genes. We also attempt direct linear regression of codon composition against genome-wide expression levels (and protein abundance data). This has some similarity with the {CAI} formalism and yields an alternative model for the prediction of expression levels based on the coding sequences of genes.

Recent advances in the single-molecule field have led to the development of techniques that add the capability of torque measurement. By combining force, displacement, torque, and rotational data, a more comprehensive description of the mechanics of a biomolecule can be achieved. In this review, we highlight a number of biological processes for which torque plays a key mechanical role. We describe the various techniques that have been developed to directly probe the torque experienced by a single molecule, and detail a variety of measurements made to date using these new technologies. We conclude by discussing a number of open questions and propose systems of study that would be well suited for analysis with torsional measurement techniques.},

	abstract = {This paper develops accurate and computationally tractable, theoretical methods to analyze equilibrium heteropolymeric transitions in superhelical {DNAs} of specified sequence and kilo-base length. Although these methods are generally applicable, their development here is focused primarily on superhelical strand separation, a heteropolymeric transition of great biological importance to which every base pair in a duplex {DNA} molecule is susceptible. Because the total number of states of this transition grows exponentially with molecular length, exact analytic methods that consider all possible states are not feasible for {DNAs} of practical interest. First, an approximate statistical mechanical analysis is developed in which all states are considered whose free energies do not exceed that of the minimum energy state by more than a specified threshold amount. An approximate partition function is constructed using these states, from which estimates of the equilibrium values of important transition parameters are calculated. Next, a density of statesanalysis is performed to estimate the influence of the neglected, high energy states. Its results are used to refine the computed equilibrium parameter values, correcting for the effects of the neglected states. Only the transition profile (the probability of transition of each base pair in the sequence) cannot be refined in this manner, although its overall accuracy can be assessed. Sample calculations analyzing the strand separation transition in superhelical {pBR}322 {DNA} show that the analytic methods developed here yield accurate results in a computationally feasible manner. Moreover, the predictions of this analysis agree closely with experimental results.},

First, our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases can be found in primary transcripts, including non-protein-coding transcripts, and those that extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic examination of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about transcription start sites, including their relationship to specific regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and histone modification. Third, a more sophisticated view of chromatin structure has emerged, including its inter-relationship with {DNA} replication and transcriptional regulation. Finally, integration of these new sources of information, in particular with respect to mammalian evolution based on inter- and intra-species sequence comparisons, has yielded new mechanistic and evolutionary insights concerning the functional landscape of the human genome.

The translational yield of each clone was determined; they varied by more than 3000-fold. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the contribution to translation initiation activity of each base at each position. Features known to be important for translation initiation, such as the initiation codon, the Shine/Dalgarno sequence, the identity of the base at position -3 and the occurrence of alternative {ATGs}, are all found to be important quantitatively for activity. No other features are found to be of general significance, although the effects of secondary structure can be seen as outliers. A comparison to a large number of natural E.coli translation initiation sites shows the information profile to be qualitatively similar although differing quantitatively. This is probably due to the selection for good translation initiation sites in the natural set compared to the low average activity of the randomized set.},

	abstract = {A {DNA} sequence rich in (A+T), located upstream of the -10, -35 region of the Escherichia coli ribosomal {RNA} promoter {rrnB} P1 and called the {UP} element, stimulates transcription by a factor of 30 in vivo, as well as in vitro in the absence of protein factors other than {RNA} polymerase ({RNAP}). When fused to other promoters, such as {lacUV}5, the {UP} element also stimulates transcription, indicating that it is a separate promoter module. Mutations in the carboxyl-terminal region of the alpha subunit of {RNAP} prevent stimulation of these promoters by the {UP} element although the mutant enzymes are effective in transcribing the "core" promoters (those lacking the {UP} element). Protection of {UP} element {DNA} by the mutant {RNAPs} is severely reduced in footprinting experiments, suggesting that the selective decrease in transcription might result from defective interactions between alpha and the {UP} element. Purified alpha binds specifically to the {UP} element, confirming that alpha acts directly in promoter recognition. Transcription of three other promoters was also reduced by the {COOH}-terminal alpha mutations. These results suggest that {UP} elements comprise a third promoter recognition region (in addition to the -10, -35 recognition hexamers, which interact with the sigma subunit) and may account for the presence of (A+T)-rich {DNA} upstream of many prokaryotic promoters. Since the same alpha mutations also block activation by some transcription factors, mechanisms of promoter stimulation by upstream {DNA} elements and positive control by certain transcription factors may be related.},

In this study, we test fundamental predictions of each of these models in the simple model enzyme T7 {RNA} polymerase. Nicking or gapping the nontranscribed template {DNA} immediately upstream of the growing hybrid yields no systematic reduction in abortive falloff, demonstrating clearly that compaction or ?scrunching? of this {DNA} is not a source of functional instability. Similarly, transcription on {DNA} in which the nontemplate strand in the initially transcribed region is either mismatched or removed altogether leads to at most modest reductions in abortive falloff, indicating that expansion or ?scrunching? of the bubble is not the primary driving force for abortive cycling. Finally, energetic stress derived from the observed steric clash of the growing hybrid against the N-terminal domain contributes at most mildly to abortive cycling, as the addition of steric bulk (additional {RNA} bases) at the upstream end of the hybrid does not lead to predicted positional shifts in observed abortive patterns. We conclude that while structural changes (scrunching) clearly occur in initial transcription, stress from these changes is not the primary force driving abortive cycling.

	abstract = {A significant fraction of {RNA} polymerase {II} transcription complexes become arrested when halted within a particular initially transcribed region after the synthesis of 23{\textendash}32-nucleotide {RNAs}. If polymerases are halted within the same sequence at a promoter-distal location, they remain elongation-competent. However, when the {RNAs} within these promoter-distal complexes are truncated to between 21 and 48 nucleotides, many of the polymerases become arrested. The degree of the arrest correlates very well with the length of the {RNA} in both the promoter-proximal and -distal complexes. This effect is also observed when comparing promoter-proximal and promoter-distal complexes halted over a completely different sequence. The unusual propensity of many promoter-proximal {RNA} polymerase {II} complexes to arrest may therefore be recreated in promoter-distal complexes simply by shortening the nascent {RNA}. Thus, the transition to full elongation competence by {RNA} polymerase {II} is dependent on the synthesis of about 50 nt of {RNA}, and this transition is reversible. We also found that arrest is facilitated in promoter-distal complexes by the hybridization of oligonucleotides to the transcript between 30 and 45 bases upstream of the 3'-end.},

New functional and structural studies now suggest how {RNAPs} select the correct nucleoside triphosphate ({NTP}) substrate to prevent transcription errors, and how the enzymes detect and remove a misincorporated nucleotide during proofreading. Proofreading begins with fraying of the misincorporated nucleotide away from the {DNA} template, which pauses transcription. Subsequent backtracking of {RNAP} by one position enables nucleolytic cleavage of an {RNA} dinucleotide that contains the misincorporated nucleotide. Since cleavage occurs at the same active site that is used for polymerization, the {RNAP} proofreading mechanism differs from that used by {DNAPs}, which contain a distinct nuclease specific active site.},

The index uses a reference set of highly expressed genes from a species to assess the relative merits of each codon, and a score for a gene is calculated from the frequency of use of all codons in that gene. The index assesses the extent to which selection has been effective in moulding the pattern of codon usage. In that respect it is useful for predicting the level of expression of a gene, for assessing the adaptation of viral genes to their hosts, and for making comparisons of codon usage in different organisms.

	abstract = {Sigma factors provide promoter recognition specificity to {RNA} polymerase holoenzyme, contribute to {DNA} strand separation, and then dissociate from the core enzyme following transcription initiation. As the regulon of a single sigma factor can be composed of hundreds of genes, sigma factors can provide effective mechanisms for simultaneously regulating expression of large numbers of prokaryotic genes. One newly emerging field is identification of the specific roles of alternative sigma factors in regulating expression of virulence genes and virulence-associated genes in bacterial pathogens. Virulence genes encode proteins whose functions are essential for the bacterium to effectively establish an infection in a host organism. In contrast, virulence-associated genes can contribute to bacterial survival in the environment and therefore may enhance the capacity of the bacterium to spread to new individuals or to survive passage through a host organism. As alternative sigma factors have been shown to regulate expression of both virulence and virulence-associated genes, these proteins can contribute both directly and indirectly to bacterial virulence. Sigma factors are classified into two structurally unrelated families, the \{sigma\}70 and the \{sigma\}54 families. The \{sigma\}70 family includes primary sigma factors (e.g., Bacillus subtilis \{sigma\}A) as well as related alternative sigma factors; \{sigma\}54 forms a distinct subfamily of sigma factors referred to as \{sigma\}N in almost all species for which these proteins have been characterized to date. We present several examples of alternative sigma factors that have been shown to contribute to virulence in at least one organism. For each sigma factor, when applicable, examples are drawn from multiple species.},

Almost all state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy, however, completely ignore the process of structure formation and focus exclusively on the final {RNA} structure.

We have isolated mutations in H. influenzae sxy that greatly elevate translation and thus cause competence to develop in otherwise non-inducing conditions (hypercompetence). In vitro nuclease analysis confirmed the existence of an extensive secondary structure at the 5' end of sxy {mRNA} that sequesters the ribosome-binding site and start codon in a stem-loop. All of the hypercompetence mutations reduced {mRNA} base pairing, and one was shown to cause a global destabilization that increased translational efficiency. Conversely, mutations engineered to add {mRNA} base pairs strengthened the secondary structure, resulting in reduced translational efficiency and greatly reduced competence for genetic transformation. Transfer of wild-type cells to starvation medium improved translational efficiency of sxy while independently triggering the sugar starvation regulator ({CRP}) to stimulate transcription at the sxy promoter. Thus, {mRNA} secondary structure is responsive to conditions where {DNA} uptake will be favorable, and transcription of sxy is simultaneously enhanced if {CRP} activation signals that energy supplies are limited.},

	abstract = {Background
In the post-genomic era, correct gene prediction has become one of the biggest challenges in genome annotation. Improved promoter prediction methods can be one step towards developing more reliable ab initio gene prediction methods. This work presents a novel prokaryotic promoter prediction method based on {DNA} stability.

Results
The promoter region is less stable and hence more prone to melting as compared to other genomic regions. Our analysis shows that a method of promoter prediction based on the differences in the stability of {DNA} sequences in the promoter and non-promoter region works much better compared to existing prokaryotic promoter prediction programs, which are based on sequence motif searches. At present the method works optimally for genomes such as that of Escherichia coli, which have near 50 \% G+C composition and also performs satisfactorily in case of other prokaryotic promoters.

Conclusions
Our analysis clearly shows that the change in stability of {DNA} seems to provide a much better clue than usual sequence motifs, such as Pribnow box and -35 sequence, for differentiating promoter region from non-promoter regions. To a certain extent, it is more general and is likely to be applicable across organisms. Hence incorporation of such features in addition to the signature motifs can greatly improve the presently available promoter prediction programs.},

The relationship between codon usage bias and gene expression has been extensively studied, and it has been shown that codon bias may have adaptive significance in many unicellular and multicellular organisms. Given the central role of {mRNA} in post-transcriptional regulation, we hypothesize that {mRNA} stability is another important factor associated either with positive or negative regulation of gene expression. We have conducted genome-wide studies of the association between gene expression (measured as transcript abundance in public {EST} databases), {mRNA} stability, codon bias, {GC} content, and gene length in Drosophila melanogaster. To remove potential bias of gene length inherently present in {EST} libraries, gene expression is measured as normalized transcript abundance. It is demonstrated that codon bias and {GC} content in second codon position are positively associated with transcript abundance. Gene length is negatively associated with transcript abundance. The stability of thermodynamically predicted {mRNA} secondary structures is not associated with transcript abundance, but there is a negative correlation between {mRNA} stability and codon bias. This finding does not support the hypothesis that codon bias has evolved as an indirect consequence of selection favoring thermodynamically stable {mRNA} molecules.},

Moreover, we show that a gene expression signature based only on the expression ratio of alternative 3' {UTRs} is a strong predictor of survival in both tumors. Genes undergoing 3'{UTR} shortening in aggressive tumors of the two tissues significantly overlap, and several of them are known to be involved in tumor progression.

The position for promoter escape on all N25-{ITS} variants occurred at the +15/+16 juncture, unlike the +11/+12 juncture for the wild type N25. These variants further exhibited a 25-fold difference in escape efficiency. {ITS} changes favoring promoter escape showed a compositional bias that is unrelated to nucleotide substrate binding affinity for the initial positions. Comparing all variants, the natural N25 promoter emerges as having evolved an {ITS} optimal for promoter escape, giving a high level of productive synthesis after undergoing the shortest abortive program. We supplemented {GreB} to transcription reactions to better understand abortive initiation and promoter escape in vivo. {GreB} supplementation elevated productive {RNA} synthesis 2-5-fold by altering the abortive {RNA} pattern, decreasing the abundance of the medium (6-10 nt) to long (11-15 nt) abortive {RNAs} without changing the levels of short (2-5 nt) and very long abortive {RNAs} (16-20 nt). The {GreB}-refractive nature of short abortive {RNA} production may reflect a minimum length requirement of 4-5 bp of the {RNA}-{DNA} hybrid for maintaining the stability of initial or backtracked complexes. That the very long abortive {RNAs} are unaffected by {GreB} suggests that they are unlikely to be products of polymerase backtracking.

Genome-wide analysis of such polyadenylation signals was missing in fission yeast, even though it is an important model organism. We demonstrate that the canonical {AATAAA} motif is the most frequent and functional polyadenylation signal in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Using analysis of {RNA}-Seq data sets from cells grown under various physiological conditions, we identify 3' {UTRs} for nearly 90\% of the yeast genes. Heterogeneity of cleavage sites is common, as is alternative polyadenylation within and between conditions. We validated the computationally identified sequence elements likely to promote polyadenylation by functional assays, including {qRT}-{PCR} and 3'{RACE} analysis. The biological importance of the {AATAAA} motif is underlined by functional analysis of the genes containing it. Furthermore, it has been shown that convergent genes require trans elements, like cohesin for efficient transcription termination. Here we show that convergent genes lacking cohesin (on chromosome 2) are generally associated with longer overlapping {mRNA} transcripts.

Structures that form within the {RNA}-exit channel can either increase pausing by interacting with {RNAP} or decrease pausing by preventing backtracking. Conversely, pausing is required for proper folding of some {RNAs}. Opening of the {RNAP} clamp domain has been proposed to mediate some effects of nascent-{RNA} structures. However, the connections among {RNA} structure formation and {RNAP} clamp movement and catalytic activity remain uncertain. Here, we assayed exit-channel structure formation in Escherichia coli {RNAP} with disulfide cross-links that favor closed- or open-clamp conformations and found that clamp position directly influences {RNA} structure formation and {RNAP} catalytic activity. We report that exit-channel {RNA} structures slow pause escape by favoring clamp opening through interactions with the flap that slow translocation.},

	abstract = {Alternative polyadenylation ({APA}) has been shown to play an important role in gene expression regulation in animals and plants. However, the extent of sense and antisense {APA} at the genome level is not known. We developed a deep-sequencing protocol that queries the junctions of 3'{UTR} and poly(A) tails and confidently maps the poly(A) tags to the annotated genome. The results of this mapping show that 70\% of Arabidopsis genes use more than one poly(A) site, excluding microheterogeneity. Analysis of the poly(A) tags reveal extensive {APA} in introns and coding sequences, results of which can significantly alter transcript sequences and their encoding proteins. Although the interplay of intron splicing and polyadenylation potentially defines poly(A) site uses in introns, the polyadenylation signals leading to the use of {CDS} protein-coding region poly(A) sites are distinct from the rest of the genome. Interestingly, a large number of poly(A) sites correspond to putative antisense transcripts that overlap with the promoter of the associated sense transcript, a mode previously demonstrated to regulate sense gene expression. Our results suggest that {APA} plays a far greater role in gene expression in plants than previously expected.},

These are often characterised by the longevity of the {DNA} strand-separated (open) complex in the presence of heparin. In contrast, such complexes are notoriously unstable at the promoters for {rRNA} and {tRNA} under similar conditions. The high G+C content within the {DNA}-melting region of these promoters has been implicated in this seemingly anomalous behaviour. Here, we used rapid-pulse {UV} laser photo-footprinting to monitor the transient structural intermediates formed at the Escherichia coli tyr T promoter. Promoter derivatives with A+T for G/C base substitutions within the G+C-rich discriminator region (-7 to -1) augmented the stability of complexes on both linear fragments and supercoiled plasmid {DNA}. Analysis of the lifetime of the preinitiation complexes as a function of the discriminator sequence reveals a direct relationship between the A+T content of the {DNA}-melting region and the stability of the ensuing complex. Our results are consistent with the premise that a G/C block to {DNA}-untwisting and/or {DNA}-melting operates to prevent the formation of the stable isomers that are implicated in most other transcription initiation pathways.},

Reverse transcription of {mRNA} isolated from E. coli containing the run of 11 A's reveals heterogeneity of transcript length while reverse transcription of {mRNA} isolated from S.cerevisiae containing the same gene shows no heterogeneity. Protein sequencing of the \{beta\}-galactosidase molecules derived from the out-of-frame construct containing a run of adenines reveals the addition of a lysine at the run. A new method was developed where messages small enough to allow resolution of single nucleotide differences on an acrylamide gel are electrophoresed, electroblotted onto nylon and probed. This confirmed the reverse transcription results and showed that additional residues can be added to transcripts derived from {DNA} containing 10 or 11 thymine residues. A mechanism for slippage is discussed where the A-U rich {RNA}-{DNA} hybrid can denature during elongation and rehybridize in an offset position, causing the addition of extra residues to the transcript.},

	abstract = {{RNA} polyadenylation occurs in most forms of life, excluding a small number of biological systems. This posttranscriptional modification undertakes two roles, both of which influence the stability of the polyadenylated transcript. One is associated with the mature 3' ends of nucleus-encoded {mRNAs} in eukaryotic cells and is important for nuclear exit, translatability, and longevity. The second form of {RNA} polyadenylation assumes an almost opposite role; it is termed {\textquoteleft}transient{\textquoteright} and serves to mediate the degradation of {RNA}. Poly(A)-assisted {RNA} decay pathways were once thought to occur only in prokaryotes/organelles but are now known to be a common phenomenon, present in bacteria, organelles, archaea, and the nucleus and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, regardless of the fact that in some of these systems, stable polyadenylation exists as well. This article will summarize the current knowledge of polyadenylation and degradation factors involved in poly(A)-assisted {RNA} decay in the domains of life, focusing mainly on that which occurs in prokaryotes and organelles. In addition, it will offer an evolutionary view of the development of {RNA} polyadenylation and degradation and the cellular machinery that is involved. {WIREs} {RNA} 2011 2 106{\textendash}123 {DOI}: 10.1002/wrna.45},

In all kingdoms of life, transcription must be finely tuned to ensure an appropriate balance between fidelity and speed. Here, we used an optical-trapping assay with high spatiotemporal resolution to probe directly the motion of individual {RNAPII} molecules as they pass through each of the enzymatic steps of transcript elongation. We report direct evidence that the {RNAPII} trigger loop, an evolutionarily conserved protein subdomain, serves as a master regulator of transcription, affecting each of the three main phases of elongation, namely: substrate selection, translocation, and catalysis. Global fits to the force-velocity relationships of {RNAPII} and its trigger loop mutants support a Brownian ratchet model for elongation, where the incoming {NTP} is able to bind in either the pre- or posttranslocated state, and movement between these two states is governed by the trigger loop. Comparison of the kinetics of pausing by {WT} and mutant {RNAPII} under conditions that promote base misincorporation indicate that the trigger loop governs fidelity in substrate selection and mismatch recognition, and thereby controls aspects of both transcriptional accuracy and rate.},

We developed a simple strategy for mitigating these complications, allowing truly digital {RNA}-Seq. Following reverse transcription, a large set of barcode sequences is added in excess, and nearly every {cDNA} molecule is uniquely labeled by random attachment of barcode sequences to both ends. After {PCR}, we applied paired-end deep sequencing to read the two barcodes and {cDNA} sequences. Rather than counting the number of reads, {RNA} abundance is measured based on the number of unique barcode sequences observed for a given {cDNA} sequence. We optimized the barcodes to be unambiguously identifiable, even in the presence of multiple sequencing errors. This method allows counting with single-copy resolution despite sequence-dependent bias and {PCR}-amplification noise, and is analogous to digital {PCR} but amendable to quantifying a whole transcriptome.

	abstract = {The {ArC}/{XylS} family of prokaryotic positive transcriptional regulators includes more than 100 proteins and polypeptides derived from open reading frames translated from {DNA} sequences. Members of this family are widely distributed and have been found in the gamma subgroup of the proteobacteria, low- and high-G + C-content gram-positive bacteria, and cyanobacteria. These proteins are defined by a profile that can be accessed from {PROSITE} {PS}01124. Members of the family are about 300 amino acids long and have three main regulatory functions in common: carbon metabolism, stress response, and pathogenesis. Multiple alignments of the proteins of the family define a conserved stretch of 99 amino acids usually located at the C-terminal region of the regulator and connected to a nonconserved region via a linker. The conserved stretch contains all the elements required to bind {DNA} target sequences and to activate transcription from cognate promoters. Secondary analysis of the conserved region suggests that it contains two potential alpha-helix-turn-alpha-helix {DNA} binding motifs. The first, and better-fitting motif is supported by biochemical data, whereas existing biochemical data neither support nor refute the proposal that the second region possesses this structure. The phylogenetic relationship suggests that members of the family have recruited the nonconserved domain(s) into a series of existing domains involved in {DNA} recognition and transcription stimulation and that this recruited domain governs the role that the regulator carries out. For some regulators, it has been demonstrated that the nonconserved region contains the dimerization domain. For the regulators involved in carbon metabolism, the effector binding determinants are also in this region. Most regulators belonging to the {AraC}/{XylS} family recognize multiple binding sites in the regulated promoters. One of the motifs usually overlaps or is adjacent to the -35 region of the cognate promoters. Footprinting assays have suggested that these regulators protect a stretch of up to 20 bp in the target promoters, and multiple alignments of binding sites for a number of regulators have shown that the proteins recognize short motifs within the protected region.},

	abstract = {The relative abundance of the {mRNAs} encoding the membrane (mu m) and secreted (mu s) forms of immunoglobulin mu heavy chain is regulated during B-cell maturation by a change in the mode of {RNA} processing. Current models to explain this regulation involve either competition between cleavage-polyadenylation at the proximal (mu s) poly(A) site and cleavage-polyadenylation at the distal (mu m) poly(A) site [poly(A) site model] or competition between cleavage-polyadenylation at the mu s poly(A) site and splicing of the C mu 4 and M1 exons, which eliminates the mu s site (mu s site-splice model). To test certain predictions of these models and to determine whether there is a unique structural feature of the mu s poly(A) site that is essential for regulation, we constructed modified mu genes in which the mu s or mu m poly(A) site was replaced by other poly(A) sites and then studied the transient expression of these genes in cells representative of both early- and late-stage lymphocytes. Substitutions at the mu s site dramatically altered the relative usage of this site and caused corresponding reciprocal changes in the usage of the mu m site. Despite these changes, use of the proximal site was still usually higher in plasmacytomas than in pre-B cells, indicating that regulation does not depend on a unique feature of the mu s poly(A) site. Replacement of the distal (mu m) site had no detectable effect on the usage of the mu s site in either plasmacytomas or pre-B cells. These findings are inconsistent with the poly(A) site model. In addition, we noted that in a wide variety of organisms, the sequence at the 5' splice junction of the C mu 4-to-M1 intron is significantly different from the consensus 5' splice junction sequence and is therefore suboptimal with respect to its complementary base pairing with U1 small nuclear {RNA}. When we mutated this suboptimal sequence into the consensus sequence, the mu {mRNA} production in plasmacytoma cells was shifted from predominantly mu s to exclusively mu m. This result unequivocally demonstrated that splicing of the C mu 4-to-M1 exon is in competition with usage of the mu s poly(A) site. A key feature of this regulatory phenomenon appears to be the appropriately balanced efficiencies of these two processing reactions. Consistent with predictions of the mu s site-splice model, B cells were found to contain mu m precursor {RNA} that had undergone the C mu 4-to-M1 splice but had not yet been polyadenylated at the mu m site.},

Understanding the pathway and kinetic mechanisms of transcription initiation is essential for quantitative understanding of gene regulation, but initiation is a multistep process, the features of which can be obscured in bulk analysis. We used a multiwavelength single-molecule fluorescence colocalization approach, {CoSMoS}, to define the initiation pathway at an activator-dependent bacterial $\sigma$54 promoter that recapitulates characteristic features of eukaryotic promoters activated by enhancer binding proteins. The experiments kinetically characterize all major steps of the initiation process, revealing heretofore unknown features, including reversible formation of two closed complexes with greatly differing stabilities, multiple attempts for each successful formation of an open complex, and efficient release of $\sigma$54 from the polymerase core at the start of transcript synthesis. Open complexes are committed to~transcription, suggesting that regulation likely targets earlier steps in the mechanism. {CoSMoS} is a powerful, generally applicable method to elucidate the mechanisms of transcription and other multistep biochemical processes.},

The mechanisms by which this effect is achieved are controversial; although some previous studies have suggested that codon bias is the most important determinant of translation efficiency, a recent study suggested that {mRNA} folding at the beginning of genes is the dominant factor via its effect on translation initiation. Using the Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptomes, we conducted a genome-scale study aiming at dissecting the determinants of translation efficiency. There is a significant association between codon bias and translation efficiency across all endogenous genes in E. coli and S. cerevisiae but no association between folding energy and translation efficiency, demonstrating the role of codon bias as an important determinant of translation efficiency. However, folding energy does modulate the strength of association between codon bias and translation efficiency, which is maximized at very weak {mRNA} folding (i.e., high folding energy) levels. We find a strong correlation between the genomic profiles of ribosomal density and genomic profiles of folding energy across {mRNA}, suggesting that lower folding energies slow down the ribosomes and decrease translation efficiency. Accordingly, we find that selection forces act near uniformly to decrease the folding energy at the beginning of genes. In summary, these findings testify that in endogenous genes, folding energy affects translation efficiency in a global manner that is not related to the expression levels of individual genes, and thus cannot be detected by correlation with their expression levels.},

The presence of a mutant protein, either $\varsigma$70(P504L) or $\varsigma$70(S506F), suppresses the physiological defects in strains devoid of {ppGpp}. In vitro, when reconstituted into {RNA} polymerase holoenzyme, these $\varsigma$ mutants confer unique transcriptional properties, namely they reduce the probabilities of forming abortive {RNAs}. Here we investigated the behavior of these mutant enzymes during transcription of the highly abortive cellular promoter, gal P2. No differences between mutant and wild-type enzymes were observed prior to and including open complex formation. Remarkably, the mutant enzymes produced drastically reduced levels of gal P2 abortive {RNAs} and increased production of full-length gal P2 {RNAs} relative to the wild-type enzyme, leading to greatly reduced ratios of abortive to productive {RNAs}. These results are attributed mainly to a decreased formation of unproductive initial transcribing complexes with the mutant polymerases and increased rates of promoter escape.

	abstract = {Background
Translation efficiency is affected by a diversity of parameters, including secondary structure of the transcript and its codon usage. Here we examine the effects of codon usage on translation efficiency by re-analysis of previously constructed synthetic expression libraries in Escherichia coli.

Results
We define the region in a gene that takes the longest time to translate as the bottleneck. We found that localization of the bottleneck at the beginning of a transcript promoted a high level of expression, especially if the computed dwell time of the ribosome within this region was sufficiently long. The location and translation time of the bottleneck were not correlated with the cost of expression, approximated by the fitness of the host cell, yet utilization of specific codons was. Particularly, enhanced usage of the codons {UCA} and {CAU} was correlated with increased cost of production, potentially due to sequestration of their corresponding rare {tRNAs}.

Conclusions
The distribution of codons along the genes appears to affect translation efficiency, consistent with analysis of natural genes. This study demonstrates how synthetic biology complements bioinformatics by providing a set-up for well controlled experiments in biology.},

	abstract = {The selective degradation of messenger {RNAs} enables cells to regulate the levels of particular {mRNAs} in response to changes in the environment. Ribonuclease ({RNase}) E (ref. 1), a single-strand-specific endonuclease2, 3, 4 that is found in a multi-enzyme complex known as the 'degradosome'5, 6, 7, initiates the degradation of many {mRNAs} in Escherichia coli3,8,9. Its relative lack of sequence specificity and the presence of many potential cleavage sites in {mRNA} substrates2,3 cannot explain why {mRNA} decay frequently proceeds in a net 5'-to-3' direction9, 10, 11. I have prepared covalently closed circular derivatives of natural substrates, the {rpsT} {mRNA} encoding ribosomal protein S20 (ref. 2) and the 9S precursor to 5S ribosomal {RNA}1,12, and find that these derivatives are considerably more resistant to cleavage in vitro by {RNase} E than are linear molecules. Moreover, antisense oligo-deoxynucleotides complementary to the 5' end of linear substrates significantly reduce the latter's susceptibility to attack by {RNase} E. Finally, natural substrates with terminal 5'-triphosphate groups are poorly cleaved by {RNase} E in vitro, whereas 5' monophosphorylated substrates are strongly preferred (compare with ref. 13). These results show that {RNase} E has inherent vectorial properties, with its activity depending on the 5' end of its substrates; this can account for the direction of {mRNA} decay in E. coli, the phenomenon of 'all or none' {mRNA} decay, and the stabilization provided by 5' stem{\textendash}loop structures14, 15, 16, 17.},

	abstract = {The 5' untranslated region ({UTR}) of the long-lived Escherichia coli {ompA} transcript functions as an {mRNA} stabilizer that can prolong the cytoplasmic lifetimes of a variety of messages to which it is fused. Previous studies have identified two domains of this 5' {UTR} that together are responsible for its stabilizing effect. One is a 5'-terminal stem-loop. The other is a single-stranded {RNA} segment (ss2) that contains a ribosome binding site highly complementary to 16S ribosomal {RNA}. Here we report a detailed investigation of the function of these two stabilizing elements. Our data indicate that {mRNA} protection by a 5' stem-loop requires no sequence features or thermodynamic stability beyond the minimum necessary for stem-loop formation. Stabilization by ss2 appears to result not from a high frequency of translation initiation, but rather from a high degree of occupancy of this 5' {UTR} segment by bound ribosomes. Although close spacing of translating ribosomes is not critical for message stabilization by the {ompA} 5' {UTR}, {mRNA} longevity does require the periodic passage of ribosomes through the protein-coding region. Unlike bound ribosomes, which hinder {mRNA} cleavage by {RNase} E, the 5' stem-loop appears to impede degradation of {ompA} {mRNA} via a distinct pathway that is {RNase} E-independent. These findings imply that the {ompA} 5' {UTR} prolongs {mRNA} longevity by impeding multiple pathways for {mRNA} degradation.},

Genome-wide analysis of such polyadenylation signals was missing in fission yeast, even though it is an important model organism. We demonstrate that the canonical {AATAAA} motif is the most frequent and functional polyadenylation signal in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Using analysis of {RNA}-Seq data sets from cells grown under various physiological conditions, we identify 3' {UTRs} for nearly 90\% of the yeast genes. Heterogeneity of cleavage sites is common, as is alternative polyadenylation within and between conditions. We validated the computationally identified sequence elements likely to promote polyadenylation by functional assays, including {qRT}-{PCR} and 3'{RACE} analysis. The biological importance of the {AATAAA} motif is underlined by functional analysis of the genes containing it. Furthermore, it has been shown that convergent genes require trans elements, like cohesin for efficient transcription termination. Here we show that convergent genes lacking cohesin (on chromosome 2) are generally associated with longer overlapping {mRNA} transcripts.

	abstract = {This article compares 32 bacterial genomes with respect to their high transcription potentialities. The $\sigma$70 promoter has been widely studied for Escherichia coli model and a consensus is known. Since transcriptional regulations are known to compensate for promoter weakness (i.e. when the promoter similarity with regard to the consensus is rather low), predicting functional promoters is a hard task. Instead, the research work presented here comes within the scope of investigating potentially high {ORF} expression, in relation with three criteria: (i) high similarity to the $\sigma$70 consensus (namely, the consensus variant appropriate for each genome), (ii) transcription strength reinforcement through a supplementary binding site{\textemdash}the upstream promoter ({UP}) element{\textemdash}and (iii) enhancement through an optimal Shine-Dalgarno ({SD}) sequence. We show that in the {AT}-rich Firmicutes{\textquoteright} genomes, frequencies of potentially strong $\sigma$70-like promoters are exceptionally high. Besides, though they contain a low number of strong promoters ({SPs}), some genomes may show a high proportion of promoters harbouring an {UP} element. Putative {SPs} of lesser quality are more frequently associated with an {UP} element than putative strong promoters of better quality. A meaningful difference is statistically ascertained when comparing bacterial genomes with similarly {AT}-rich genomes generated at random; the difference is the highest for Firmicutes. Comparing some Firmicutes genomes with similarly {AT}-rich Proteobacteria genomes, we confirm the Firmicutes specificity. We show that this specificity is neither explained by {AT}-bias nor genome size bias; neither does it originate in the abundance of optimal {SD} sequences, a typical and significant feature of Firmicutes more thoroughly analysed in our study.},

Nevertheless, there is no mechanistic requirement for release of $\sigma$ upon the transition to elongation. Furthermore, $\sigma$ can remain associated with {RNAP} during transcription elongation and influence regulatory events that occur during transcription elongation. Here we demonstrate that promoter-like {DNA} sequence elements within the initial transcribed region that are known to induce early elongation pausing through sequence-specific interactions with $\sigma$ also function to increase the $\sigma$ content of downstream elongation complexes.

Analysis of the transcription effects of substitutions and deletions in this region in Escherichia coli $\sigma$70 subunit, performed in this work, suggests that (i) individual residues in the $\sigma$3.2 finger collectively contribute to {RNA} priming by {RNAP}, likely by the positioning of the template {DNA} strand in the active centre, but are not critical to promoter escape; (ii) the physical presence of $\sigma$3.2 in the {RNA} exit channel is important for promoter escape; (iii) $\sigma$3.2 promotes $\sigma$ dissociation during initiation and suppresses $\sigma$-dependent promoter-proximal pausing; (iv) $\sigma$3.2 contributes to allosteric inhibition of the initiating {NTP} binding by rifamycins.

Elucidating the mechanism of transcription initiation by {RNA} polymerases ({RNAP}) is essential for understanding gene transcription and regulation. Although several models, such as {DNA} scrunching, {RNAP} translation, and {RNAP} rotation, have been proposed, the mechanism of initiation by T7 {RNAP} has remained unclear. Using ensemble and single-molecule F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer ({FRET}) studies, we provide evidence for concerted {DNA} scrunching and rotation during initiation by T7 {RNAP}. A constant spatial distance between the upstream and downstream edges of initiation complexes making 4{\textendash}7 nt {RNA} supports the {DNA} scrunching model, but not the {RNAP} translation or the pure rotation model. {DNA} scrunching is accompanied by moderate hinging motion (18{\textdegree} {\textpm} 4{\textdegree}) of the promoter toward the downstream {DNA}. The observed stepwise conformational changes provide a basis to understand abortive {RNA} synthesis during early stages of initiation and promoter escape during the later stages that allows transition to processive elongation.},

The study of transcription fidelity has been limited because the intrinsic error rate of transcription is obscured by the higher error rate of translation, making identification of phenotypes associated with transcription infidelity challenging. Slippage of elongating {RNA} polymerase ({RNAP}) on homopolymeric A/T tracts in {DNA} represents a special type of transcription error leading to disruption of open reading frames in Escherichia coli {mRNA}. However, the regions in {RNAP} involved in elongation slippage and its molecular mechanism are unknown. We constructed an A/T tract that is out of frame relative to a downstream {lacZ} gene on the chromosome to examine transcriptional slippage during elongation. Further, we developed a genetic system that enabled us for the first time to isolate and characterize E. coli {RNAP} mutants with altered transcriptional slippage in vivo. We identified several amino acid residues in the $\beta$ subunit of {RNAP} that affect slippage in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, these highly clustered residues are located near the {RNA} strand of the {RNA}-{DNA} hybrid in the elongation complex. Our E. coli study complements an accompanying study of slippage by yeast {RNAP} {II} and provides the basis for future studies on the mechanism of transcription fidelity.},

Like alternative splicing, usage of alternative poly(A) sites allows a single gene to encode multiple {mRNA} transcripts. In some cases, this changes the {mRNA} coding potential; in other cases, the code remains unchanged but the 3' {UTR} length is altered, influencing the fate of {mRNAs} in several ways, for example, by altering the availability of {RNA} binding protein sites and {microRNA} binding sites. The mechanisms governing both global and gene-specific {APA} are only starting to be deciphered.

	abstract = {In Bacillus subtilis and other Gram-positive bacteria, pyrimidine-mediated regulation of the {pyrG} gene, which encodes {CTP} synthetase, occurs through an attenuation mechanism involving an intrinsic transcription terminator in the {pyrG} leader region. Low intracellular levels of {CTP} prevent termination at the attenuator by a mechanism that requires the nontemplate strand sequence {GGGC} at the {pyrG} transcription initiation site (first G =+1) and the leader transcript sequence {GCUCCC} located at the 5' end of the terminator {RNA} hairpin. In this study, we demonstrate that reiterative transcription adds G residues (up to at least 10) to the 5' end of {pyrG} transcripts when B. subtilis cells are starved for pyrimidines but not when cells are grown with excess cytidine. Regulated repetitive addition of G residues, as well as pyrimidine-mediated {pyrG} regulation, requires the sequence {GGGC} or {GGGT} at the start of {pyrG} transcription. Mutational insertion of four extra G residues at the 5' end of the {pyrG} transcript (i.e., 5'-{GGGGGGGC}) results in constitutive {pyrG} expression. We propose that the incorporation of extra G residues by reiterative transcription at the wild-type promoter occurs when normal transcription elongation is stalled at position +4 by low levels of the incoming substrate, {CTP}, during pyrimidine limitation. The poly(G) extensions on the 5' ends of {pyrG} transcripts act to prevent transcription attenuation by base pairing with the sequence {CUCCCUUUC} located in the 5' strand of the terminator hairpin. This control mechanism is likely to operate in other Gram-positive bacteria containing similar {pyrG} leader sequences.},

As an alternative, we present here a computational method for rationally designing o-ribosomes in bacteria. Working under the assumption that base-pair interactions between the 16S {rRNA} and {mRNA} serve as the primary mode for ribosome binding and translational initiation, the algorithm enumerates all possible extended recognition sequences for 16S {rRNA} and then chooses those candidates that: (i) have a similar binding strength to their target {mRNA} as the canonical, wild-type ribosome/{mRNA} pair; (ii) do not bind {mRNA} with the wild-type, canonical Shine-Dalgarno ({SD}) sequence and (iii) minimally interact with host {mRNA} irrespective of whether a recognizable {SD} sequence is present. In order to test the algorithm, we experimentally characterized a number of computationally designed o-ribosomes in Escherichia coli.},

This relationship, which is a generalization of equilibrium conditions to the case of a chemical process occurring in a nonequilibrium steady state in dilute solution, provides a novel equivalent definition for chemical reaction free energy. In addition, it is shown that previously unrelated theories introduced by Ussing and Hodgkin and Huxley for transport of ions across membranes, Hill for catalytic cycle fluxes, and Crooks for entropy production in microscopically reversible systems, are united in a common framework based on this relationship.},

	abstract = {Promoter escape is the last stage of transcription initiation when {RNA} polymerase, having initiated de novo phosphodiester bond synthesis, must begin to relinquish its hold on promoter {DNA} and advance to downstream regions ({DSRs}) of the template. In vitro, this process is marked by the release of high levels of abortive transcripts at most promoters, reflecting the high instability of initial transcribing complexes ({ITCs}) and indicative of the existence of barriers to the escape process. The high abortive initiation level is the result of the existence of unproductive {ITCs} that carry out repeated initiation and abortive release without escaping the promoter. The formation of unproductive {ITCs} is a widespread phenomenon, but it occurs to different extent on different promoters. Quantitative analysis of promoter mutations suggests that the extent and pattern of abortive initiation and promoter escape is determined by the sequence of promoter elements, both in the promoter recognition region ({PRR}) and the initial transcribed sequence ({ITS}). A general correlation has been found that the stronger the promoter {DNA}-polymerase interaction, the poorer the ability of {RNA} polymerase to escape the promoter. In gene regulation, promoter escape can be the rate-limiting step for transcription initiation. An increasing number of regulatory proteins are known to exert their control at this step. Examples are discussed with an emphasis on the diverse mechanisms involved. At the molecular level, the X-ray crystal structures of {RNA} polymerase and its various transcription complexes provide the framework for understanding the functional data on abortive initiation and promoter escape. Based on structural and biochemical evidence, a mechanism for abortive initiation and promoter escape is described.},

	abstract = {Advances in the fields of catalysis and electrochemical energy conversion often involve nanoparticles, which can have kinetics surprisingly different from the bulk material. Classical theories of chemical kinetics assume independent reactions in dilute solutions, whose rates are determined by mean concentrations. In condensed matter, strong interactions alter chemical activities and create variations that can dramatically affect the reaction rate. The extreme case is that of a reaction coupled to a phase transformation, whose kinetics must depend not only on the order parameter but also on its gradients at phase boundaries. Reaction-driven phase transformations are common in electrochemistry, when charge transfer is accompanied by ion intercalation or deposition in a solid phase. Examples abound in Li-ion, metal?air, and lead?acid batteries, as well as metal electrodeposition?dissolution. Despite complex thermodynamics, however, the standard kinetic model is the Butler?Volmer equation, based on a dilute solution approximation. The Marcus theory of charge transfer likewise considers isolated reactants and neglects elastic stress, configurational entropy, and other nonidealities in condensed phases. The limitations of existing theories recently became apparent for the Li-ion battery material {LixFePO}4 ({LFP}). It has a strong tendency to separate into Li-rich and Li-poor solid phases, which scientists believe limits its performance. Chemists first modeled phase separation in {LFP} as an isotropic ?shrinking core? within each particle, but experiments later revealed striped phase boundaries on the active crystal facet. This raised the question: What is the reaction rate at a surface undergoing a phase transformation? Meanwhile, dramatic rate enhancement was attained with {LFP} nanoparticles, and classical battery models could not predict the roles of phase separation and surface modification. In this Account, I present a general theory of chemical kinetics, developed over the past 7 years, which is capable of answering these questions. The reaction rate is a nonlinear function of the thermodynamic driving force, the free energy of reaction, expressed in terms of variational chemical potentials. The theory unifies and extends the Cahn?Hilliard and Allen?Cahn equations through a master equation for nonequilibrium chemical thermodynamics. For electrochemistry, I have also generalized both Marcus and Butler?Volmer kinetics for concentrated solutions and ionic solids. This new theory provides a quantitative description of {LFP} phase behavior. Concentration gradients and elastic coherency strain enhance the intercalation rate. At low currents, the charge-transfer rate is focused on exposed phase boundaries, which propagate as ?intercalation waves?, nucleated by surface wetting. Unexpectedly, homogeneous reactions are favored above a critical current and below a critical size, which helps to explain the rate capability of {LFP} nanoparticles. Contrary to other mechanisms, elevated temperatures and currents may enhance battery performance and lifetime by suppressing phase separation. The theory has also been extended to porous electrodes and could be used for battery engineering with multiphase active materials. More broadly, the theory describes nonequilibrium chemical systems at mesoscopic length and time scales, beyond the reach of molecular simulations and bulk continuum models. The reaction rate is consistently defined for inhomogeneous, nonequilibrium states, for example, with phase separation, large electric fields, or mechanical stresses. This research is also potentially applicable to fluid extraction from nanoporous solids, pattern formation in electrophoretic deposition, and electrochemical dynamics in biological cells.},

There is significant flexibility in the transcription start site, which causes variable spacing between the promoter elements and the start site; this in turn causes differences in the length and sequence at the 5' end of {RNA} transcripts and can be important for gene regulation. The start-site variability also implies the presence of some flexibility in the positioning of the {DNA} relative to the {RNAP} active site in {RPo}. The flexibility may occur in the positioning of the transcription bubble prior to {RNA} synthesis and may reflect bubble expansion ({\textquotedblleft}scrunching{\textquotedblright}) or bubble contraction ({\textquotedblleft}unscrunching{\textquotedblright}). Here, we assess the presence of dynamic flexibility in {RPo} with single-molecule {FRET} (F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer). We obtain experimental evidence for dynamic flexibility in {RPo} using different {FRET} rulers and labeling positions. An analysis of {FRET} distributions of {RPo} using burst variance analysis reveals conformational fluctuations in {RPo} in the millisecond timescale. Further experiments using subsets of nucleotides and {DNA} mutations allowed us to reprogram the transcription start sites, in a way that can be described by repositioning of the single-stranded transcription bubble relative to the {RNAP} active site within {RPo}. Our study marks the first experimental observation of conformational dynamics in the transcription bubble of {RPo} and indicates that {DNA} dynamics within the bubble affect the search for transcription start sites.},

Although it has long been thought that virtually all long {RNA} polymerase {II} transcripts terminate in a poly(A) tail that is generated by endonucleolytic cleavage followed by polyadenylation, noncanonical 3' end processing mechanisms have recently been identified at several gene loci. Unexpectedly, enzymes with well-characterized roles in other {RNA} processing events, such as {tRNA} biogenesis and pre-{mRNA} splicing, cleave these nascent transcripts to generate their mature 3' ends despite the presence of nearby polyadenylation signals. In fact, the presence of multiple potential 3' end cleavage sites is the norm at many human genes, and recent work suggests that the choice among sites is regulated during development and in response to cellular cues. It is, therefore, becoming increasing clear that the selection of a proper 3' end cleavage site represents an important step in the regulation of gene expression and that the mature 3' ends of {RNA} polymerase {II} transcripts can be generated via multiple mechanisms.},

Despite remarkable progress in single-molecule techniques revealing important mechanistic details of transcription elongation ({TE}) with up to base-pair resolution, some of the results and interpretations of these studies are difficult to reconcile, and have not yet led to a minimal unified picture of transcription. We propose a simple model that accounts quantitatively for many of the experimental observations. This model belongs to the class of isothermal ratchet models of {TE} involving the thermally driven stochastic backward and forward motion (backtracking and forward tracking) of {RNAP} along {DNA} between single-nucleotide incorporation events. We uncover two essential features for the success of the model. The first is an intermediate state separating the productive elongation pathway from nonelongating backtracked states. The rates of entering and exiting this intermediate state modulate pausing by {RNAP}. The second crucial ingredient of the model is the cotranscriptional folding of the {RNA} transcript, sterically inhibiting the extent of backtracking. This model resolves several apparent differences between single-molecule studies and provides a framework for future work on {TE}.},

	abstract = {We present a computational model of {DNA}-binding by $\sigma$70 in Escherichia coli which allows us to extract the functional characteristics of the wider promoter environment. Our model is based on a measure for the binding energy of $\sigma$70 to the {DNA}, which is derived from promoter strength data and used to build up a non-standard weight matrix. Opposed to conventional approaches, we apply the matrix to the environment of 3765 known promoters and consider the average matrix scores to extract the common features. In addition to the expected minimum of the average binding energy at the exact promoter site, we detect two minima shortly upstream and downstream of the promoter. These are likely to occur due to correlation between the two binding sites of $\sigma$70. Moreover, we observe a characteristic energy landscape in the 500 bp surrounding the transcription start sites, which is more pronounced in groups of strong promoters than in groups of weak promoters. Our subsequent analysis suggests that the characteristic energy landscape is more likely an influence on target search by the {RNA} polymerase than a result of nucleotide biases in transcription factor binding sites.},

Behavior of the mutant enzymes on three test templates, bearing either the T7 A1, T5 N25, or T5 N25antiDSR promoter, were characterized. Transcription of all three promoter templates produced a pattern of specific abortive {RNA} species, which was qualitatively different for the mutants compared to the wild-type $\sigma$70 enzyme. Short abortive {RNAs} were produced at similar levels for mutant and wild-type enzymes. The production of longer abortive species was either reduced or increased by the mutant enzymes in a systematic manner that appears promoter-specific, and could be {RNA} length- or promoter distance-dependent. The process of abortive {RNA} transcription is thought to be tightly associated with that of promoter clearance. However, promoter clearance from these templates appears only slightly affected by the mutant enzymes. These mutants implicated region 3 of $\sigma$70 in the process of abortive transcription and suggest that the sequence of enzymatic events leading to the production of abortive or full-length {RNA} may be separable.},

Since detection of an {RNA} molecule is the major criterion to define transcriptional activity, the fraction of the genome that is expressed is generally considered to parallel the complexity of the transcriptome. We show here that several supposedly silent intergenic regions in the genome of S. cerevisiae are actually transcribed by {RNA} polymerase {II}, suggesting that the expressed fraction of the genome is higher than anticipated. Surprisingly, however, {RNAs} originating from these regions are rapidly degraded by the combined action of the exosome and a new poly(A) polymerase activity that is defined by the Trf4 protein and one of two {RNA} binding proteins, Air1p or Air2p. We show that such a polyadenylation-assisted degradation mechanism is also responsible for the degradation of several Pol I and Pol {III} transcripts. Our data strongly support the existence of a posttranscriptional quality control mechanism limiting inappropriate expression of genetic information.},

However, there are two exceptional mechanisms, which do not require the {SD} sequence for translation initiation: one is mediated by a ribosomal protein S1 ({RPS}1) and the other used leaderless {mRNA} that lacks its 5' {UTR}. To understand the evolutionary changes of the mechanisms of translation initiation, we examined how universal the {SD} sequence is as an effective initiator for translation among prokaryotes. We identified the {SD} sequence from 277 species (249 eubacteria and 28 archaebacteria). We also devised an {SD} index that is a proportion of {SD}-containing genes in which the differences of {GC} contents are taken into account. We found that the {SD} indices varied among prokaryotic species, but were similar within each phylum. Although the anti-{SD} sequence is conserved among species, loss of the {SD} sequence seems to have occurred multiple times, independently, in different phyla. For those phyla, {RPS}1-mediated or leaderless {mRNA}-used mechanisms of translation initiation are considered to be working to a greater extent. Moreover, we also found that some species, such as Cyanobacteria, may acquire new mechanisms of translation initiation. Our findings indicate that, although translation initiation is indispensable for all protein-coding genes in the genome of every species, its mechanisms have dynamically changed during evolution.},

	abstract = {It has long been known that during initial transcription of the first 8-10 bases of {RNA}, complexes are relatively unstable, leading to the release of short abortive {RNA} transcripts. An early stressed intermediate model led to a more specific mechanistic model proposing scrunching stress as the basis for the instability. Recent studies in the single subunit T7 {RNA} polymerase have argued against scrunching as the energetic driving force and instead argue for a model in which pushing of the {RNA}-{DNA} hybrid against a protein element associated with promoter binding, while likely driving promoter release, reciprocally leads to instability of the hybrid. In the current study, we test these models in the structurally unrelated multi-subunit bacterial {RNA} polymerase. Via the targeted introduction of mismatches and nicks in the {DNA}, we demonstrate that neither downstream bubble collapse nor compaction/scrunching of either the single stranded template or nontemplate strands is a major force driving abortive instability (although collapse from the downstream end of the bubble does contribute significantly to instability of artificially halted complexes). In contrast, pushing of the hybrid against a mobile protein element ($\sigma$3.2 in the bacterial enzyme) results in substantially increased abortive instability and is likely the primary energetic contributor to abortive cycling. The results suggest that abortive instability is a byproduct of the mechanistic need to couple the energy of nucleotide addition ({RNA} chain growth) to driving the timed release of promoter contacts during initial transcription.},

As T7RNAP is homologous to the Pol I family of {DNA} polymerases, the differences between the structure of T7RNAP complexed to substrates and that of the corresponding {DNA} polymerase complex provides a structural basis for understanding many of these functional differences. T7RNAP initiates {RNA} synthesis at promoter sequences that are conserved from positions {\textbar}[minus]{\textbar}17 to {\textbar}[plus]{\textbar}6 relative to the start site of transcription. The crystal structure at 2.4{\textbar}[thinsp]{\textbar}{\textbar}[Aring]{\textbar} resolution of T7RNAP complexed with a 17-base-pair promoter shows that the four base pairs closest to the catalytic active site have melted to form a transcription bubble. The T7 promoter sequence is recognized by interactions in the major groove between an antiparallel {\textbar}[beta]{\textbar}-loop and bases. The amino-terminal domain is involved in promoter recognition and {DNA} melting. We have also used homology modelling of the priming and incoming nucleoside triphosphates from the T7 {DNA}-polymerase ternary complex structure to explain the specificity of T7RNAP for ribonucleotides, its ability to initiate from a single nucleotide, and the abortive cycling at the initiation of transcription.},

Deletion of these upstream sequences from {MS}2 {cDNA} plasmids results in a 30-fold reduction of translational efficiency. By site-directed mutagenesis, we show that this low level of expression is caused by a hairpin structure centred around the initiation codon. When this hairpin is destabilized by the introduction of mismatches, expression from the truncated messenger increases 20-fold to almost the level of the full-length construct. Thus, the translational effect of hundreds of upstream nucleotides can be mimicked by a single substitution that destabilizes the structure. The same hairpin is also present in full-length {MS}2 {RNA}, but there it does not impair ribosome binding. Apparently, the upstream {RNA} somehow reduces the inhibitory effect of the structure on translational initiation. The upstream {MS}2 sequence does not stimulate translation when cloned in front of another gene, nor can unrelated {RNA} segments activate the coat-protein gene. Several possible mechanisms for the activation are discussed and a function in gene regulation of the phage is suggested.},

Here we describe a general mechanism that governs {RNA} polymerase ({RNAP}) movement and response to regulatory inputs such as pauses, terminators, and elongation factors. We show that E.coli {RNAP} moves by a complex Brownian ratchet mechanism, which acts prior to phosphodiester bond formation. The incoming substrate and the flexible F bridge domain of the catalytic center serve as two separate ratchet devices that function in concert to drive forward translocation. The adjacent G loop domain controls F bridge motion, thus keeping the proper balance between productive and inactive states of the elongation complex. This balance is critical for cell viability since it determines the rate, processivity, and fidelity of transcription.},

Here, we use surface plasmon resonance ({SPR}) technology to monitor {RNA} transcription by Escherichia coli {RNA} polymerase ({RNAP}) in solution and in real time. We show that binding of {RNAP} to immobilized {DNA} templates to form active initiation or elongation complexes can be resolved and monitored by this method, and that changes during transcription that involve the gain or loss of bound mass, including the release of the sigma factor during the initiation{\textendash}elongation transition, the synthesis of the {RNA} transcript, and the release of core {RNAP} and nascent {RNA} at intrinsic terminators, can all be observed. The {SPR} method also permits the discrimination of released termination products from paused and other intermediate complexes at terminators. We have used this approach to show that the rate constant for transcript release at intrinsic terminators {tR}2 and {tR}' is ?2{\textendash}3 s-1 and that the extent of release at these terminators is consistent with known termination efficiencies.

We have analyzed the influences of individual {DNA} elements within the promoter recognition region ({PRR}) on these reactions by measuring the quantitative initiation parameters that describe abortive initiation and promoter escape; these parameters are the abortive rate, the productive rate, the abortive:productive ratio, the abortive probability, and the maximum size of abortive transcripts. Changes in the individual {DNA} elements within the {PRR} can have a substantial effect on each of these parameters. The discriminator region and the ?10 element primarily influence the abortive probability at positions 2?5 and 6?10, respectively, while the ?10 and ?35 conserved hexamers and the spacer region affect the abortive probability at positions 11?15. Surprisingly, transcription of a consensus promoter invariably gives a higher abortive yield, a higher abortive probability, a longer abortive ladder, and a lower productive rate than promoter variants carrying even a single deviation in the consensus hexamers. These results suggest that strong {RNA} polymerase?{PRR} interactions stall the polymerase at the promoter, thereby reducing the rate of promoter escape and consequently enhancing the extent of abortive initiation.},

It involves multiple stable intermediates and a rezipping into a completely non-native conformation before unfolding. The principle that emerges, for which there is growing experimental support, is that although protein folding tends to involve highly cooperative two-state thermodynamic transitions, without detectable intermediates, the folding of {RNA} secondary structures may involve rugged landscapes, often with more complex intermediate states.},

Cellular {RNAs} are subject to quality-control pathways that insure the fidelity of gene expression. We previously identified a 79 nt element, the {ENE}, that is essential for the nuclear accumulation of a viral polyadenylated nuclear ({PAN}) {RNA}. Here, we show that intron-less polyadenylated transcripts such as {PAN} {RNA} and [beta]-globin {cRNA} exhibit two-component exponential decay kinetics in which some transcripts are rapidly degraded (t1/2 = {\textasciitilde}15 min) while others decay more slowly (t1/2 = {\textasciitilde}3 hr). Inclusion of the {ENE} protects such transcripts from rapid decay in a poly(A)-dependent fashion. The {ENE} inhibits deadenylation and decay in nuclear extract and prevents deadenylation of naked {RNA} by a purified deadenylase, likely through {snoRNA}-like intramolecular hybridization with the poly(A) tail. The {ENE} causes increased accumulation of splicing-defective [beta]-globin pre-{mRNAs} in~vivo. We propose that the {ENE}-controlled rapid-decay mechanism for polyadenylated transcripts comprises a nuclear pre-{mRNA} surveillance system in mammalian cells.},

In this work, we extended its aims by generating experimental data at a genome scale on {TSSs}, promoters and regulatory regions. We implemented a modified 5' {RACE} protocol and an unbiased High Throughput Pyrosequencing Strategy ({HTPS}) that allowed us to map more than 1700 {TSSs} with high precision. From this collection, about 230 corresponded to previously reported {TSSs}, which helped us to benchmark both our methodologies and the accuracy of the previous mapping experiments. The other ca 1500 {TSSs} mapped belong to about 1000 different genes, many of them with no assigned function. We identified promoter sequences and type of $\sigma$ factors that control the expression of about 80\% of these genes. As expected, the housekeeping $\sigma$70 was the most common type of promoter, followed by $\sigma$38. The majority of the putative {TSSs} were located between 20 to 40 nucleotides from the translational start site. Putative regulatory binding sites for transcription factors were detected upstream of many {TSSs}. For a few transcripts, riboswitches and small {RNAs} were found. Several genes also had additional {TSSs} within the coding region. Unexpectedly, the {HTPS} experiments revealed extensive antisense transcription, probably for regulatory functions. The new information in {RegulonDB}, now with more than 2400 experimentally determined {TSSs}, strengthens the accuracy of promoter prediction, operon structure, and regulatory networks and provides valuable new information that will facilitate the understanding from a global perspective the complex and intricate regulatory network that operates in E. coli.},

Transcriptional pausing by multisubunit {RNA} polymerases ({RNAPs}) is a key mechanism for regulating gene expression in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and is a prerequisite for transcription termination. Pausing and termination states are thought to arise through a common, elemental pause state that is inhibitory for nucleotide addition. We report three crystal structures of Thermus {RNAP} elemental paused elongation complexes ({ePECs}). The structures reveal the same relaxed, open-clamp {RNAP} conformation in the {ePEC} that may arise by failure to re-establish {DNA} contacts during translocation. A kinked bridge-helix sterically blocks the {RNAP} active site, explaining how this conformation inhibits {RNAP} catalytic activity. Our results provide a framework for understanding how {RNA} hairpin formation stabilizes the paused state and how the {ePEC} intermediate facilitates termination.},

We validated the computationally identified sequence elements likely to promote polyadenylation by functional assays, including {qRT}-{PCR} and 3'{RACE} analysis. The biological importance of the {AATAAA} motif is underlined by functional analysis of the genes containing it. Furthermore, it has been shown that convergent genes require trans elements, like cohesin for efficient transcription termination. Here we show that convergent genes lacking cohesin (on chromosome 2) are generally associated with longer overlapping {mRNA} transcripts. Our bioinformatic and experimental genome-wide results are summarized and can be accessed and customized in a user-friendly database Pomb(A).},

	abstract = {Escherichia coli promoters show a large degree of sequence variation. However, they are all recognized specifically by {RNA} polymerase as the sites for transcription initiation, suggesting that they share common basic structural features distinguishing them from the rest of the sequence. Our hypothesis is that the promoter is determined not only by the two consensus sequences at 201310 and 201335, but also by the surrounding nucleotides, and that it is not only the identity of the nucleotides that is important for promoter function but the presence of specific physical-chemical and structural characteristics that are sequence dependent. This approach is supported by accumulating evidence indicating the role that the {DNA} conformation may play in modulating protein-{DNA} interaction. In this study, four intrinsic sequence-dependent characteristics are examined in E. coli promoter regions: helix stability, helix flexibility, and two conformational parameters represented by the {DNA} tendencies for B2192Z and B2192A transition. The promoter is defined by the consensus sequences and their vicinity and the examined properties are compared between promoter and random sequences. It is demonstrated that both the consensus and flanking regions are less stable, more flexible and show a higher tendency for the B conformation in comparison to random sequences. Discriminant analysis is used to evaluate the relative contributions of the various characteristics.},

Transcriptional pausing by {RNA} polymerase ({RNAP}) plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. Defined, sequence-specific pause sites have been identified biochemically. Single-molecule studies have also shown that bacterial {RNAP} pauses frequently during transcriptional elongation, but the relationship of these {\textquotedblleft}ubiquitous{\textquotedblright} pauses to the underlying {DNA} sequence has been uncertain. We employed an ultrastable optical-trapping assay to follow the motion of individual molecules of {RNAP} transcribing templates engineered with repeated sequences carrying imbedded, sequence-specific pause sites of known regulatory function. Both the known and ubiquitous pauses appeared at reproducible locations, identified with base-pair accuracy. Ubiquitous pauses were associated with {DNA} sequences that show similarities to regulatory pause sequences. Data obtained for the lifetimes and efficiencies of pauses support a model where the transition to pausing branches off of the normal elongation pathway and is mediated by a common elemental state, which corresponds to the ubiquitous pause.},

	abstract = {Negatively twisted {DNA} is essential to many biological functions. Due to torsional stress, duplex {DNA} can have local, sequence-dependent structural defects. In this work, a thermodynamic model of {DNA} was built to qualitatively predict the local sequence-dependent mechanical instabilities under torsional stress. The results were compared to both simulation of a coarse-grained model and experiment results. By using the Kirkwood superposition approximation, we built an analytical model to represent the free energy difference $\Delta$W of a hydrogen-bonded basepair between the B-form helical state and the basepair opened (or locally melted) state, within a given sequence under torsional stress. We showed that $\Delta$W can be well approximated by two-body interactions with its nearest-sequence-neighbor basepairs plus a free energy correction due to long-range correlations. This model is capable of rapidly predicting the position and thermodynamics of local defects in a given sequence. The result qualitatively matches with an in~vitro experiment for a long {DNA} sequence (\&gt;4000 basepairs). The 12 parameters used in this model can be further quantitatively refined when more experimental data are available.},

	abstract = {During transcription initiation from {galP}2, one of the two promoters of the Escherichia coli galactose operon with an initially transcribed sequence of {pppAUUUC}, {RNA} polymerase ({RNAP}) is known to engage nonproductive stuttering synthesis, which is sensitive to the concentration of {UTP}. This study examines the effect of this nonproductive synthesis on promoter clearance and determines other parameters that might affect stuttering synthesis by analyzing a mutant {RNAP}, {RpoB}3449, that has altered its function at this process at {galP}2. {RpoB}3449 has dramatically diminished stuttering synthesis, and consequently, it has increased the rate of productive initiation due to its enhanced rate of promoter clearance of {galP}2 compared with wild-type {RNAP}. Thus, a direct linkage between promoter clearance and productive transcription is demonstrated. The mechanism by which the mutant {RNAP} has altered the switch between nonproductive stuttering synthesis and productive initiation during promoter clearance is studied. Apparently, {RpoB}3449 has increased its efficiency in incorporating {CTP} at the +5 position of the {galP}2 transcript leading to its reduced stuttering synthesis, indicating that the rate of an {RNAP} incorporating the {CTP} after a stretch of uridine residues is important for promoter clearance at {galP}2. Because {RpoB}3449 demonstrates "wild-type" stuttering synthesis at the mutant {galP}2 promoter, which contains the 6 residue at the +5 position, it indicates that the mutant {RNAP} has altered in binding {CTP} at this context. Further experiments indicate that it is the +5 position per se of the {galP}2 sequence rather than a particular nucleotide at that position that is critical in determining the switch between the two alternate pathways during transcription initiation. A checkpoint model for the switch between nonproductive and productive initiations during promoter clearance is discussed.},

Residual {mRNAs} are polyadenylated, indicating that Pap1-5p retains at least partial activity. In pap1-5 strains lacking Rrp6p, a nucleus-specific component of the exosome complex of 3'-5' exonucleases, accumulation of poly(A)+ {mRNA} was largely restored and growth was improved. The catalytically inactive mutant Rrp6-1p did not increase growth of the pap1-5 strain and conferred much less {mRNA} stabilization than rrp6\{Delta\}. This may indicate that the major function of Rrp6p is in {RNA} surveillance. Inactivation of core exosome components, Rrp41p and Mtr3p, or the nuclear {RNA} helicase Mtr4p gave different phenotypes, with accumulation of deadenylated and 3'-truncated {mRNAs}. We speculate that slowed {mRNA} polyadenylation in the pap1-5 strain is detected by a surveillance activity of Rrp6p, triggering rapid deadenylation and exosome-mediated degradation. In wild-type strains, assembly of the cleavage and polyadenylation complex might be suboptimal at cryptic polyadenylation sites, causing slowed polyadenylation.},

	abstract = {The process of {RNA} chain initiation by {RNA} polymerases plays a central role in the regulation of transcription. In this complex phase of transcription, short oligomers are synthesized and released from the enzyme-promoter complex in a reaction termed abortive initiation. The polymerase undergoes many cycles of abortive initiation prior to completion of the initiation process, which is signaled by the translocation of the enzyme away from the promoter, release of sigma factor, and formation of an elongation complex in which the {RNA} is stably bound. We have studied the parameters that affect escape from the promoter by Escherichia coli {RNA} polymerase for the phage T7 A1 promoter, the phage T5 N25 promoter, and the chimeric promoter T5 N25antiDSR. The latter site contains a synthetic initial transcribed region that reduces its ability to synthesize {RNA} both in vivo and in vitro. Clearance from T5 N25antiDSR can be stimulated up to 10-fold in vitro by addition of the E. coli transcript cleavage factor {GreA} or {GreB}, but these factors have little effect on transcription from the normal T7 A1 or T5 N25 promoters. Using an E. coli strain lacking {GreA} and {GreB}, we were also able to show stimulation of transcription by the Gre factors from the T5 N25antiDSR promotor in vivo. The stimulation of {RNA} chain initiation by Gre factors, together with their known biochemical properties in the transcription elongation reaction, suggests some specific models for steps in the transcription initiation reaction.},

	abstract = {Background
Histone protein synthesis is essential for cell proliferation and required for the packaging of {DNA} into chromatin. In animals, histone proteins are provided by the expression of multicopy replication-dependent histone genes. Histone {mRNAs} that are processed by a histone-specific mechanism to end after a highly conserved {RNA} hairpin element, and lack a poly(A) tail. In vertebrates and Drosophila, their expression is dependent on {HBP}/{SLBP} that binds to the {RNA} hairpin element. We showed previously that these cis and trans acting regulators of histone gene expression are conserved in C. elegans. Here we report the results of an investigation of the histone {mRNA} 3' end structure and of histone gene expression during C. elegans development.

Results
Sequence analysis of replication-dependent histone genes revealed the presence of several highly conserved sequence elements in the 3' untranslated region of histone pre-{mRNAs}, including an {RNA} hairpin element and a polyadenylation signal. To determine whether in C. elegans histone {mRNA} 3' end formation occurs at this polyadenylation signal and results in polyadenylated histone {mRNA}, we investigated the {mRNA} 3' end structure of histone {mRNA}. Using poly(A) selection, {RNAse} protection and sequencing of histone {mRNA} ends, we determined that a majority of C. elegans histone {mRNAs} lack a poly(A) tail and end three to six nucleotides after the hairpin structure, after an A or a U, and have a 3' {OH} group. {RNAi} knock down of {CDL}-1, the C. elegans {HBP}/{SLBP}, does not significantly affect histone {mRNA} levels but severely depletes histone protein levels. Histone gene expression varies during development and is reduced in L3 animals compared to L1 animals and adults. In adults, histone gene expression is restricted to the germ line, where cell division occurs.

Conclusion
Our findings indicate that the expression of C. elegans histone genes is subject to control mechanisms similar to the ones in other animals: the structure of C. elegans histone {mRNA} 3' ends is compatible with histone-specific {mRNA} 3' end processing; {CDL}-1 functions in post-transcriptional control of histone gene expression; and C. elegans histone {mRNA} levels are elevated at periods of active cell division, indicating that histone gene expression is linked to {DNA} replication.},

We found that the sequence conservation of $\sigma$70 binding sites is 6.5 {\textpm} 0.1 bits. Some promoters lack a -35 region, but have a 6.7 {\textpm} 0.2 bit extended -10, almost the same information as the bipartite promoter.

Binding predicted by the bipartite model is enriched around 35 bases upstream of the translational start. This distance is the smallest 5' {mRNA} leader necessary for ribosome binding, suggesting that selective pressure minimizes transcript length.

	abstract = {The 3' untranslated regions (3'{UTRs}) of {mRNAs} contain cis elements involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Over half of all mammalian genes contain multiple polyadenylation sites that lead to different 3'{UTRs} for a gene. Studies have shown that the alternative polyadenylation ({APA}) pattern varies across tissues, and is dynamically regulated in proliferating or differentiating cells. Generation of induced pluripotent stem ({iPS}) cells, in which differentiated cells are reprogrammed to an embryonic stem ({ES}) cell-like state, has been intensively studied in recent years. However, it is not known how 3'{UTRs} are regulated during cell reprogramming.

Using a computational method that robustly examines {APA} across {DNA} microarray data sets, we analyzed 3'{UTR} dynamics in generation of {iPS} cells from different cell types. We found that 3'{UTRs} shorten during reprogramming of somatic cells, the extent of which depends on the type of source cell. By contrast, reprogramming of spermatogonial cells involves 3'{UTR} lengthening. The alternative polyadenylation sites that are highly responsive to change of cell state in generation of {iPS} cells are also highly regulated during embryonic development in opposite directions. Compared with other sites, they are more conserved, can lead to longer alternative 3'{UTRs}, and are associated with more cis elements for polyadenylation. Consistently, reprogramming of somatic cells and germ cells involves significant upregulation and downregulation, respectively, of {mRNAs} encoding polyadenylation factors, and {RNA} processing is one of the most significantly regulated biological processes during cell reprogramming. Furthermore, genes containing target sites of {ES} cell-specific {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) in different portions of 3'{UTR} are distinctively regulated during cell reprogramming, suggesting impact of {APA} on {miRNA} targeting.

Taken together, these findings indicate that reprogramming of 3'{UTRs} by {APA}, which result from regulation of both general polyadenylation activity and cell type-specific factors and can reset post-transcriptional gene regulatory programs in the cell, is an integral part of {iPS} cell generation, and the {APA} pattern can be a good biomarker for cell type and state, useful for sample classification. The results also suggest that perturbation of the {mRNA} polyadenylation machinery or {RNA} processing activity may facilitate generation of {iPS} cells.},

By contrast, {GC}-rich sequences (60\% {GC}) are found to undergo a reversible overstretching transition into a distinct form that is characterized by a 51\% extension and that remains base-paired. For the first time, results proving the existence of a stretched basepaired form of {DNA} can be presented.

In humans, polyadenylation of messenger {RNA} ({mRNA}) protects transcripts from degradation and enhances translation efficiency. Conversely, in bacteria, polyadenylation destabilizes {mRNA}. {RNA} adenylation was recently implicated in promoting degradation of some yeast {RNAs} by the exosome. The exosome complex of exoribonucleases is a major degradation machine in eukaryotes, and many of its components share significant homology with bacterial exonucleases. The human [beta]-globin pre-{mRNA} is cotranscriptionally cleaved within its 3' flank. Here, we show that some {RNA} ends, coinciding with these cotranscriptionally cleaved regions, contain short A tails on their 3' ends. Moreover, all of the pre-{mRNA} species detected accumulate in the absence of the exosome. We have also detected adenylation on {RNA} 3' ends originating within the mouse serum albumin ({MSA}) 3' flanking region {RNA}. This step in pre-{mRNA} degradation may represent an additional role for adenylation in mammals.},

In Bacteria, transcription is catalyzed by a single {RNA} polymerase ({RNAP}) whose promoter selectivity and activity is governed by a wide variety of transcription factors. The net effect of these transcriptional regulators is to determine which genes are transcribed, and at what levels, under any specific growth condition. {RNAP} thus serves as a nexus of gene regulation that integrates the information coming from a variety of sensory systems to appropriately modulate gene expression. The techniques presented in this volume provide a set of tools and approaches for investigating the factors controlling {RNAP} activity at both individual promoters and on a genomic scale. This introductory chapter provides a brief overview of {RNAP} and the transcription cycle and introduces general principles of how the fundamental steps of transcription are influenced by both {DNA} (promoter) sequences and trans-acting factors.},

	abstract = {A synthetic ribosome-binding site ({RBS}) containing a 7-nucleotide-long Shine-Dalgarno ({SD}) sequence was placed ahead of the rat interferon ({IFN})-$\alpha$1 coding region. The translational efficiency of this construct was extremely low. Structural probing of transcripts with {RNases} T1 and U2 combined with computer predictions revealed the presence of a stable hairpin in which the {SD} region was base-paired to codons 3, 4 and 5 of the {IFN} {mRNA}. Each mutation in this stem changing an A-U to an A {\textperiodcentered} C or a G-C a G {\textperiodcentered} U pair increased translational efficiency about fourfold and this effect could be reversed by a compensating stabilizing substitution in the other strand of the stem. We conclude that the strength of an {RBS} is to a major degree determined by its involvement in secondary structure. We also show that the negative effect of secondary structure on the efficiency of an {RBS} can be overcome by allowing upstream translation to terminate within the base-paired region. In our clones, termination-dependent restarts occur at a frequency comparable to that taking place in constructs containing destabilized hairpins.},

Through error-prone {PCR} both in the coding sequence and the regulatory sequence of E. coli alkaline phosphatase, the cellular enzyme activity has been efficiently enhanced. Sequence analysis revealed that the resultant mutant 34-B12, which showed a sevenfold increased enzyme activity at the cellular level, contains three mutations in the regulatory sequence and another three mutations in the coding sequence. Activity assays of the enzyme containing the corresponding amino acid substitutions proved that the amino acid mutations contribute only to a small portion to the increased cellular enzyme activity. So the mutations in the 5'-untranslated region were analyzed separately and combinationally. The results suggested that one mutation yielded a stronger promoter and the other two mutations both elevated the E. coli alkaline phosphatase expression at the translational level; moreover, a stronger Shine-Dalgarno sequence was generated.},

Using global and reporter-based nuclear run-on assays, we found that {RNA} polymerase {II} is more likely to pause at the {polyA} site of highly expressed genes than that of lowly expressed ones. Moreover, highly expressed genes tend to have a lower level of nucleosome but higher H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 levels at promoter-proximal {polyA} sites relative to distal ones.

To test Cufflinks, we sequenced and analyzed {\textgreater}430 million paired 75-bp {RNA}-Seq reads from a mouse myoblast cell line over a differentiation time series. We detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62\% of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the dominant transcription start site ({TSS}) or splice isoform, and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes.

In this context, the construction of a library of synthetic promoters of Escherichia coli as a useful tool for fine tuning gene expression is discussed here.{RESULTS}:A degenerated oligonucleotide sequence that encodes consensus sequences for E. coli promoters separated by spacers of random sequences has been designed and synthesized. This 57 bp long sequence contains 24 conserved, 13 semi-conserved (W, R and D) and 20 random nucleotides. This mixture of {DNA} fragments was cloned into a promoter probing vector ({pVIK}165). The ligation mixtures were transformed into competent E. coli {MA}8 and the resulting clones were screened for {GFP} activity by measuring the relative fluorescence units; some clones produced high fluorescence intensity, others weak fluorescence intensity. The clones cover a range of promoter activities from 21.79 {RFU}/{OD}600 ml to 7606.83 {RFU}/{OD}600 ml. 57 promoters were sequenced and used for promoter analysis. The present results conclusively show that the postulates, which link promoter strength to anomalies in the -10 box and/or -35 box, and to the length of the spacer, are not generally valid. However, by applying Partial Least Squares regression, a model describing the promoter strength was built and validated.{CONCLUSION}:For Escherichia coli, the promoter strength can not been linked to anomalies in the -10 box and/or -35 box, and to the length of the spacer. Also a probabilistic approach to relate the promoter sequence to its strength has some drawbacks. However, by applying Partial Least Squares regression, a good correlation was found between promoter sequence and promoter strength. This {PLS} model can be a useful tool to rationally design a suitable promoter in order to fine tune gene expression.},

The exosome complex of 3'-5' exonucleases participates in {RNA} maturation and quality control and can rapidly degrade {RNA}-protein complexes in vivo. However, the purified exosome showed weak in vitro activity, indicating that rapid {RNA} degradation requires activating cofactors. This work identifies a nuclear polyadenylation complex containing a known exosome cofactor, the {RNA} helicase Mtr4p; a poly(A) polymerase, Trf4p; and a zinc knuckle protein, Air2p. In vitro, the Trf4p/Air2p/Mtr4p polyadenylation complex ({TRAMP}) showed distributive {RNA} polyadenylation activity. The presence of the exosome suppressed poly(A) tail addition, while {TRAMP} stimulated exosome degradation through structured {RNA} substrates. In vivo analyses showed that {TRAMP} is required for polyadenylation and degradation of {rRNA} and {snoRNA} precursors that are characterized exosome substrates. Poly(A) tails stimulate {RNA} degradation in bacteria, suggesting that this is their ancestral function. We speculate that this function was maintained in eukaryotic nuclei, while cytoplasmic {mRNA} poly(A) tails acquired different roles in translation.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The number of bacterial genomes being sequenced is increasing very rapidly and hence, it is crucial to have procedures for rapid and reliable annotation of their functional elements such as promoter regions, which control the expression of each gene or each transcription unit of the genome. The present work addresses this requirement and presents a generic method applicable across organisms.Results: Relative stability of the {DNA} double helical sequences has been used to discriminate promoter regions from non-promoter regions. Based on the difference in stability between neighboring regions, an algorithm has been implemented to predict promoter regions on a large scale over 913 microbial genome sequences. The average free energy values for the promoter regions as well as their downstream regions are found to differ, depending on their {GC} content. Threshold values to identify promoter regions have been derived using sequences flanking a subset of translation start sites from all microbial genomes and then used to predict promoters over the complete genome sequences. An average recall value of 72\% (which indicates the percentage of protein and {RNA} coding genes with predicted promoter regions assigned to them) and precision of 56\% is achieved over the 913 microbial genome dataset.Availability: The binary executable for {\textquoteleft}{PromPredict}{\textquoteright} algorithm (implemented in {PERL} and supported on Linux and {MS} Windows) and the predicted promoter data for all 913 microbial genomes are available at http://nucleix.mbu.iisc.ernet.in/prombase/.Contact: mb@mbu.iisc.ernet.{inSupplementary} information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {We recently described a novel basal bacterial promoter element that is located downstream of the {\textendash}10 consensus promoter element and is recognized by region 1.2 of the $\sigma$ subunit of {RNA} polymerase ({RNAP}). In the case of {RNAP}, this element has a consensus sequence {GGGA} and allows transcription initiation in the absence of the {\textendash}35 element. In contrast, the {RNAP} is unable to initiate transcription from {GGGA}-containing promoters that lack the {\textendash}35 element. In the present study, we demonstrate that $\sigma$ subunits from both and specifically recognize the {GGGA} element and that the observed species specificity of recognition of {GGGA}-containing promoters is determined by the {RNAP} core enzyme. We further demonstrate that transcription initiation by {RNAP} on {GGGA}-containing promoters in the absence of the {\textendash}35 element requires $\sigma$ region 4 and C-terminal domains of the $\alpha$ subunits, which interact with upstream promoter {DNA}. When in the context of promoters containing the {\textendash}35 element, the {GGGA} element is recognized by holoenzyme {RNAPs} from both and and increases stability of promoter complexes formed on these promoters. Thus, {GGGA} is a basal promoter element that can function in various bacteria and, depending on the properties of the {RNAP} core enzyme and the presence of additional promoter elements, determine species-specific differences in promoter recognition.},

Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

Moreover, we found an inverse correlation between the number of rare codons in a gene, which delay ribosome progression, and the rate of transcription. The stimulating effect of a ribosome on {RNAP} is achieved by preventing its spontaneous backtracking, which enhances the pace and also facilitates readthrough of roadblocks in vivo.

Using limited trypsin digestion and stopped-flow fluorescence kinetic methods, we have monitored promoter release, initial bubble collapse, and refolding of the 152{\textendash}205 region (subdomain H), the latter being important for {RNA} channel formation. The kinetic studies show that the conformational changes are temporally coupled, commencing at the synthesis of 9 nt and completing by the synthesis of 12 nt of {RNA}. The temporal coupling of initial bubble collapse and {RNA} channel formation is proposed to facilitate proper binding of the {RNA} dissociated from the late initiation complexes into the {RNA} channel. Using promoter mutations, we have determined that promoter contacts are broken sequentially during transition from initiation to elongation. The specificity loop interactions are broken after synthesis of 8 nt or 9 nt of {RNA}, whereas the upstream promoter contacts persists up to synthesis of 12 nt of {RNA}. Both promoter contacts need to be broken for transition into elongation. The A-15C mutation resulted in efficient transition to elongation by synthesis of 9 nt of {RNA}, whereas the C-9A mutation resulted in early transition to elongation by synthesis of 7{\textendash}8 nt of {RNA}. The effect of early promoter clearance in the mutant promoters was observed as reduced production of long abortive products.},

	abstract = {The recently described crystal structures of multi-subunit {RNA} polymerases ({RNAPs}) reveal a conserved loop-like feature called the lid. The lid projects from the clamp domain and contacts the flap, thereby enclosing the {RNA} transcript in {RNAP}'s {RNA}-exit channel and forming the junction between the exit channel and the main channel, which holds the {RNA}:{DNA} hybrid. In the initiating form of bacterial {RNAP} (holoenzyme containing [sigma]), the lid interacts with [sigma] region 3 and encloses an extended linker between [sigma] region 3 and [sigma] region 4 in place of the {RNA} in the exit channel. During initiation, the lid may be important for holding open the transcription bubble and may help displace the {RNA} from the template {DNA} strand. To test these ideas, we constructed and characterized a mutant {RNAP} from which the lid element was deleted. [Delta]lid {RNAP} exhibited dramatically reduced activity during initiation from -35-dependent and -35-independent promoters, verifying that the lid is important for stabilizing the open promoter complex during initiation. However, transcript elongation, {RNA} displacement, and, surprisingly, transcriptional termination all occurred normally in [Delta]lid {RNAP}. Importantly, [Delta]lid {RNAP} behaved differently from wild-type {RNAP} when transcribing single-stranded {DNA} templates where it synthesized long, persistent {RNA}:{DNA} hybrids, in contrast to efficient transcriptional arrest by wild-type {RNAP}.},

In this study, we investigated the human endothelial nitric oxide synthase ({eNOS}) 3'-{UTR} to evaluate its potential regulatory role. 3'-{RACE} analysis revealed that the human {eNOS} {mRNA} has multiple alternative polyadenylation sites. Apart from the proximal site (418~bp downstream of the stop codon), we identified two additional distal sites approximately 770 and 1478~bp downstream of the stop codon. In addition, Northern analysis showed that the usage of these sites differed among human tissues. Further, amounts of these {eNOS} {mRNAs} were changed during growth of cultured human aortic endothelial cells; {mRNAs} with long 3'-{UTRs} decreased more rapidly than total {mRNA}, as cells approached confluency. Thus, the 3'-{UTRs} of human {eNOS} results from alternative polyadenylation sites and differ across tissues and during cell growth.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Rationally designed synthetic {DNA} cassettes were introduced into the 5prime untranslated region of a modified {lacZ} gene to form hairpins at the 5prime end of the {mRNA}. These {DNA} inserts influenced {mRNA} half-lives over an order-of-magnitude range, with some groups of predicted structures having half-lives that showed a strong correlation with hairpin strength while half-lives for another group of predicted structures exhibited little or no dependence on this property. These results indicate the importance of 5prime hairpin structure and strength in determining stabilization of Escherichia coli {mRNA}.

Here we report that many pseudoknots can be predicted through long-time-scale {RNA}-folding simulations, which follow the stochastic closing and opening of individual {RNA} helices. The numerical efficacy of these stochastic simulations relies on an ??(n2) clustering algorithm that computes time averages over a continuously updated set of n reference structures. Applying this exact stochastic clustering approach, we typically obtain a 5- to 100-fold simulation speed-up for {RNA} sequences up to 400 bases, while the effective acceleration can be as high as 105-fold for short, multistable molecules (<=150 bases). We performed extensive folding statistics on random and natural {RNA} sequences and found that pseudoknots are distributed unevenly among {RNA} structures and account for up to 30\% of base pairs in G+C-rich {RNA} sequences (online {RNA}-folding kinetics server including pseudoknots: http://kinefold.u-strasbg.fr).},

	abstract = {We have previously shown that stable base-pairing at a translational initiation site in Escherichia coli can inhibit translation by competing with the binding of ribosomes. When the base-pairing is not too strong, this competition is won by the ribosomes, resulting in efficient translation from a structured ribosome binding site ({RBS}). We now re-examine these results in the light of {RNA} folding kinetics and find that the window during which a folded {RBS} is open is generally much too short to recruit a 30 S ribosomal subunit from the cytoplasm. We argue that to achieve efficient expression, a 30 S subunit must already be in contact with the {mRNA} while this is still folded, to shift into place as soon as the structure opens. Single-stranded regions flanking the structure may constitute a standby site, to which the 30 S subunit can attach non-specifically. We propose a steady-state kinetic model for the early steps of translational initiation and use this to examine various quantitative aspects of standby binding. The kinetic model provides an explanation of why the earlier equilibrium competition model predicted implausibly high 30 S-{mRNA} affinities. Because all {RNA} is structured to some degree, standby binding is probably a general feature of translational initiation.},

Our approach was based on assigning specific values of a to each of 10 distinct dinucleotide steps. We prepared {DNA} fragments, each about 200 bp in length, with various quasi-periodic sequences, measured their cyclization efficiencies (j factors), and fitted the data by the theoretical equation to obtain the values of a for each fragment. From these data, we obtained a set of a for the dinucleotide steps. To test this set, we used it to design {DNA} sequences that should correspond to very low and very high values of a, prepared the corresponding fragments, and determined their values of a experimentally. The measured and calculated values of a were very close to one another, confirming that we have found the correct solution to this long-standing problem.

Our approach uses fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor distances between a fluorescent probe incorporated in {RNA} polymerase ({RNAP}) and a fluorescent probe incorporated in {DNA}. We observe small, but reproducible and abortive-product-length-dependent, decreases in distance between the {RNAP} leading edge and {DNA} downstream of {RNAP} upon abortive initiation, and we observe large decreases in distance upon promoter escape. Inspection of population distributions and single-molecule time traces for abortive initiation indicates that, at a consensus promoter, at saturating ribonucleoside triphosphate concentrations, abortive-product release is rate-limiting (i.e., abortive-product synthesis and {RNAP}-active-center forward translocation are fast, whereas abortive-product dissociation and {RNAP}-active-center reverse translocation are slow). The results obtained using this new methodology confirm and extend those obtained from diffusing single molecules, and pave the way for real-time, single-molecule observations of the transitions between various states of the transcription complex throughout transcription.},

The work presented here reveals that a stem-loop sequestering the Fst ribosome binding site is required for translational repression but a helix sequestering the 5' end of {RNA} I is not. Furthermore, disruption of the stem-loop prevented {RNA} {II}-mediated repression of Fst translation in vivo. Finally, although Fst-encoding wild-type {RNA} I is not toxic in Escherichia coli, mutations affecting stem-loop stability resulted in toxicity in this host, presumably due to increased translation.},

	abstract = {{mRNA} polyadenylation and pre-{mRNA} splicing are two essential steps for the maturation of most human {mRNAs}. Studies have shown that some genes generate {mRNA} variants involving both alternative polyadenylation and alternative splicing. Polyadenylation in introns can lead to conversion of an internal exon to a 3' terminal exon, which is termed composite terminal exon, or usage of a 3' terminal exon that is otherwise skipped, which is termed skipped terminal exon. Using {cDNA}/{EST} and genome sequences, we identified polyadenylation sites in introns for all currently known human genes. We found that \~{}20\% human genes have at least one intronic polyadenylation event that can potentially lead to {mRNA} variants, most of which encode different protein products. The conservation of human intronic poly(A) sites in mouse and rat genomes is lower than that of poly(A) sites in 3'-most exons. Quantitative analysis of a number of {mRNA} variants generated by intronic poly(A) sites suggests that the intronic polyadenylation activity can vary under different cellular conditions for most genes. Furthermore, we found that weak 5' splice site and large intron size are the determining factors controlling the usage of composite terminal exon poly(A) sites, whereas skipped terminal exon poly(A) sites tend to be associated with strong polyadenylation signals. Thus, our data indicate that dynamic interplay between polyadenylation and splicing leads to widespread polyadenylation in introns and contributes to the complexity of transcriptome in the cell.},

	abstract = {The elastic properties of a molecule of duplex {DNA} are strongly dependent on nucleotide sequence. In the theory developed here the contribution $\psi$ n of the nth base-pair step to the elastic energy is assumed to be given by a function $\psi$? n of six kinematical variables, called tilt, roll, twist, shift, slide, and rise, that describe the relative orientation and displacement of the n th and (n+1) th base pairs. The sequence dependence of elastic properties is determined when one specifies the way $\psi$? n depends on the nucleotides of the two base pairs of the nth step. Among the items discussed are the symmetry relations imposed on $\psi$? n by the complementarity of bases, i.e., of A to T and C to G, the antiparallel nature of the {DNA} sugar{\textendash}phosphate chains, and the requirement that $\psi$? n be independent of the choice of the direction of increasing n. Variational equations of mechanical equilibrium are here derived without special assumptions about the form of the functions $\psi$? n , and numerical solutions of those equations are shown for illustrative cases in which $\psi$? n is, for each n, a quadratic form and the {DNA} forms a closed, 150 base-pair, minicircle that can be called a {DNA} o-ring because it has a nearly circular stress-free configuration. Examples are given of noncircular equilibrium configurations of naked {DNA} o-rings and of cases in which the interaction with ligands induces changes in configuration that are markedly different from those undergone by a minicircle of intrinsically straight {DNA}. When a minicircle of intrinsically straight {DNA} interacts with an intercalating agent that upon binding to {DNA} causes a local reduction of intrinsic twist, the configuration that minimizes elastic energy depends on the number of intercalated molecules, but is independent of the spatial distribution of those molecules along the minicircle. In contrast, it is shown here that the configuration and elastic energy of a {DNA} o-ring can depend strongly on the spatial distribution of the intercalated molecules. As others have observed in calculations for Kirchhoff rods with intrinsic curvature, an o-ring that has its intrinsic twist reduced at a single base-pair step can undergo large deformations with localized untwisting and bending at remote steps, even when the amount $\alpha$ of twist reduction is less than the amount required to induce supercoiling in rings of intrinsically straight {DNA}. We here find that the presence in the functions $\psi$? n of cross-terms coupling twist to roll can amplify the configurational changes induced by local untwisting to the point where there can be a value of $\alpha$ at which a first-order transition occurs between two distinct stable noncircular configurations with equal elastic energy.},

The nonsense-mediated {mRNA} decay ({NMD}) pathway rids eukaryotic cells of {mRNAs} with premature termination codons. There is contradictory evidence as to whether mammalian {NMD} is a nuclear or a cytoplasmic process. Here, we show evidence that {NMD} in human cells occurs primarily, if not entirely, in the cytoplasm. Polypeptides designed to inhibit interactions between {NMD} factors specifically impede {NMD} when exogenously expressed in the cytoplasm. However, restricting the polypeptides to the nucleus strongly impairs their {NMD}-inhibitory function, even for those intended to inhibit interactions between the exon-junction complex ({EJC}) and {hUpf}3 proteins, which localize primarily in the nucleus. {NMD} substrates classified based on cell fractionation assays as {\textquotedblleft}nucleus associated{\textquotedblright} or {\textquotedblleft}cytoplasmic{\textquotedblright} are all inhibited in the same manner. Furthermore, retention of the {NMD} factor {hUpf}1 in the nucleus strongly impairs {NMD}.

The translation initiation efficiency of a given {mRNA} is determined by its translation initiation region ({TIR}). {mRNAs} are selected into 30S initiation complexes according to the strengths of the secondary structure of the {TIR}, the pairing of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence with 16S {rRNA}, and the interaction between initiator {tRNA} and the start codon.

Kinetic analysis reveals that 50S subunit joining and dissociation of {IF}3 are strongly influenced by the nature of the codon used for initiation and the structural elements of the {TIR}. Coupling between the {TIR} and the rate of 70S initiation complex formation involves {IF}3- and {IF}1-induced rearrangements of the 30S subunit, providing a mechanism by which the ribosome senses the {TIR} and determines the efficiency of translational initiation of a particular {mRNA}.},

Little is known about the {RNAP} transition kinetics and the steps that dictate the transition rate, because of the challenge in monitoring subpopulations of the transient and heterogeneous transcribing complexes in rapid and real time. Here, we have dissected the complete transcription initiation pathway of T7 {RNAP} by using kinetic modeling of {RNA} synthesis and by determining the initiation ({IC}) to elongation ({EC}) transition kinetics at each {RNA} polymerization step using single-molecule and stopped-flow {FRET} methods. We show that the conversion of {IC} to {EC} in T7 {RNAP} consensus promoter occurs only after 8- to 12-nt synthesis, and the 12-nt synthesis represents a critical juncture in the transcriptional initiation pathway when {EC} formation is most efficient. We show that the slow steps of transcription initiation, including {DNA} scrunching/{RNAP}{\textendash}promoter rotational changes during 5- to 8-nt synthesis, not the major conformational changes, dictate the overall rate of {EC} formation in T7 {RNAP} and represent key steps that regulate the synthesis of full-length {RNA}.},

We argue that this characterization is incomplete and present a library of engineered promoters of varying strengths obtained through mutagenesis of a constitutive promoter. A multifaceted characterization of the library, especially at the single-cell level to ensure homogeneity, permitted quantitative assessment correlating the effect of gene expression levels to improved growth and product formation phenotypes in Escherichia coli. Integration of these promoters into the chromosome can allow for a quantitative accurate assessment of genetic control. To this end, we used the characterized library of promoters to assess the impact of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase levels on growth yield and deoxy-xylulose-P synthase levels on lycopene production. The multifaceted characterization of promoter strength enabled identification of optimal expression levels for ppc and dxs, which maximized the desired phenotype. Additionally, in a strain preengineered to produce lycopene, the response to deoxy-xylulose-P synthase levels was linear at all levels tested, indicative of a rate-limiting step, unlike the parental strain, which exhibited an optimum expression level, illustrating that optimal gene expression levels are variable and dependent on the genetic background of the strain. This promoter library concept is illustrated as being generalizable to eukaryotic organisms (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and thus constitutes an integral platform for functional genomics, synthetic biology, and metabolic engineering endeavors.

To elucidate the structural basis of differential {mRNA} stability in bacteria, the domains of the {ompA} 5'-untranslated region that allow it to protect {mRNA} from degradation have been identified by mutational analysis. The presence of a stem-loop no more than 2-4 nucleotides from the extreme 5' terminus of this {RNA} segment is crucial to its stabilizing influence, whereas the sequence of the stem-loop is relatively unimportant. The potential to form a hairpin very close to the 5' end is a feature common to a number of stable prokaryotic messages. Moreover, the lifetime of a normally labile message (bla {mRNA}) can be prolonged in E. coli by adding a simple hairpin structure at its 5' terminus. Accelerated degradation of {ompA} {mRNA} in the absence of a 5'-terminal stem-loop appears to start downstream of the 5' end. We propose that E. coli messages beginning with a single-stranded {RNA} segment of significant length are preferentially targeted by a degradative ribonuclease that interacts with the {mRNA} 5' terminus before cleaving internally at one or more distal sites.},

We investigated the binding of E. coli {RNA} polymerase holoenzymes bearing [sigma]70, [sigma]S, [sigma]32, or [sigma]54 to the ribosomal {RNA} operons (rrn) in vivo. At the rrn promoter, we observed "holoenzyme switching" from E[sigma]70 to E[sigma]S or E[sigma]32 in response to environmental cues. We also examined if sigma factors are retained by core polymerase during transcript elongation. At the rrn operons, [sigma]70 translocates briefly with the elongating polymerase and is released stochastically from the core polymerase with an estimated half-life of {\textasciitilde}4-7 s. Similarly, at {gadA} and {htpG}, operons that are targeted by E[sigma]S and E[sigma]32, respectively, we find that [sigma]S and [sigma]32 also dissociate stochastically, albeit more rapidly than [sigma]70, from the elongating core polymerase. Up to {\textasciitilde}70\% of E[sigma]70 (the major vegetative holoenzyme) in rapidly growing cells is engaged in transcribing the rrn operons. Thus, our results suggest that at least {\textasciitilde}70\% of cellular holoenzymes release [sigma]70 during transcript elongation. Release of sigma factors during each round of transcription provides a simple mechanism for rapidly reprogramming polymerase with the relevant sigma factor and is consistent with the occurrence of a "sigma cycle" in vivo.},

Regulated {mRNA} stability is achieved through fluctuations in half-lives in response to developmental or environmental stimuli like nutrient levels, cytokines, hormones and temperature shifts as well as environmental stresses like hypoxia, hypocalcemia, viral infection, and tissue injury. Furthermore, in specific disorders like some forms of neoplasia, thalassemia and Alzheimer's disease, deregulated {mRNA} stability can lead to the aberrant accumulation of {mRNAs} and the proteins they encode. This review presents a discussion of some recently identified examples of regulated and deregulated {mRNA} stability in order to illustrate the diversity of genes regulated by alterations in the degradation rates of their {mRNAs}.},

With structural information now available for {RNAP} and models of ternary elongation complexes, the interaction between these factors and {RNAP} can be modelled, and possible molecular mechanisms of their action can be inferred. The models suggest that these factors interact with {RNAP} at or near its three major, nucleic acid-binding channels: Mfd near the upstream opening of the primary ({DNA}-binding) channel, {NusA} in the vicinity of both the primary channel and the {RNA} exit channel, and {GreA} within the secondary (backtracked {RNA}-binding) channel, and support the view that these channels are involved in the maintenance of {RNAP} processivity.},

Frequent codirectional collisions between the replisome and {RNA} polymerase ({RNAP}) are inevitable because the rate of replication is much faster than that of transcription. Here we show that, in E.~coli, the outcome of such collisions depends on the productive state of transcription elongation complexes ({ECs}). Codirectional collisions with backtracked (arrested) {ECs} lead to {DNA} double-strand breaks ({DSBs}), whereas head-on collisions do not. A mechanistic model is proposed to explain backtracking-mediated {DSBs}. We further show that bacteria employ various strategies to avoid replisome collisions with backtracked {RNAP}, the most general of which is translation that prevents {RNAP} backtracking. If translation is abrogated, {DSBs} are suppressed by elongation factors that either prevent backtracking or reactivate backtracked {ECs}. Finally, termination factors also contribute to genomic stability by removing arrested {ECs}. Our results establish {RNAP} backtracking as the intrinsic hazard to chromosomal integrity and implicate active ribosomes and other anti-backtracking mechanisms in genome maintenance.},

Poly(A)-binding proteins ({PABPs}) are important to eukaryotic gene expression. In the nucleus, the {PABP} {PABPN}1 is thought to function in polyadenylation of pre-{mRNAs}. Deletion of fission yeast pab2, the homolog of mammalian {PABPN}1, results in transcripts with markedly longer poly(A) tails, but the nature of the hyperadenylated transcripts and the mechanism that leads to {RNA} hyperadenylation remain unclear. Here we report that Pab2 functions in the synthesis of noncoding {RNAs}, contrary to the notion that {PABPs} function exclusively on protein-coding {mRNAs}. Accordingly, the absence of Pab2 leads to the accumulation of polyadenylated small nucleolar {RNAs} ({snoRNAs}). Our findings suggest that Pab2 promotes poly(A) tail trimming from pre-{snoRNAs} by recruiting the nuclear exosome. This work unveils a function for the nuclear {PABP} in {snoRNA} synthesis and provides insights into exosome recruitment to polyadenylated {RNAs}.},

Since the pioneering work of Grantham'a group (1, 2) it has been apparent that genes from one species often share similarities incodon frequency; under the {\textquotedblleft}genome hypothesis{\textquotedblright} (1, 2) there is a species-specific pattern to codon usage.
However, it has become clear that in most species there are also considerable differences among genes (3{\textendash}7). Multivariate analyses have revealed that in each species so far examined there is a single major trend in codon usage among genes, usually from highly biased to more nearly even usage of synonymous codons. Thus, to represent the codon usage pattern of an organism it is not sufficient to sum over all genes (8), as this conceals the underlying heterogeneity. Rather, it is necessary to describe the trend among genes seen in that species. We illustrate these trends for six species where codon usage has been examined in detail, by presenting the pooled codon usage for the 10\% of genes at either end of the major trend (Table 1).
Closely-related organisms have similar patterns of codon usage, and so the six species in Table 1 are representative of wider groups. For example, with respect to codon usage, Salmonella typhimurlum closely resembles E. coli (9), while all mammalian species so far examined (principally mouse, rat and cow) largely resemble humans (4, 8).},

We confirm directly, by measuring the length of {RNA} within isolated transcription elongation complexes, that a newly transcribed poly(A) signal reduces the rate of elongation by {RNA} polymerase {II} and causes the accumulation of elongation complexes downstream from the poly(A) signal. We then show that if the {RNA} in these elongation complexes contains a functional but unprocessed poly(A) signal, degradation of the transcripts ensues. The degradation depends on the unprocessed poly(A) signal being functional, and does not occur if a mutant poly(A) signal is used. We suggest that during normal 3'-end processing the uncleaved poly(A) signal continuously samples competing reaction pathways for processing and for degradation, and that in the case of weak poly(A) signals, where poly(A) site cleavage is slow, the default pathway to degradation predominates.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Differential polyadenylation is a widespread mechanism in higher eukaryotes producing {mRNAs} with different 3' ends in different contexts. This involves several alternative polyadenylation sites in the 3' {UTR}, each with its specific strength. Here, we analyze the vicinity of human polyadenylation signals in search of patterns that would help discriminate strong and weak polyadenylation sites, or true sites from randomly occurring signals.


{RESULTS}

We used human genomic sequences to retrieve the region downstream of polyadenylation signals, usually absent from {cDNA} or {mRNA} databases. Analyzing 4956 {EST}-validated polyadenylation sites and their -300/+300 nt flanking regions, we clearly visualized the upstream ({USE}) and downstream ({DSE}) sequence elements, both characterized by U-rich (not {GU}-rich) segments. The presence of a {USE} and a {DSE} is the main feature distinguishing true polyadenylation sites from randomly occurring A(A/U){UAAA} hexamers. While {USEs} are indifferently associated with strong and weak poly(A) sites, {DSEs} are more conspicuous near strong poly(A) sites. We then used the region encompassing the hexamer and {DSE} as a training set for poly(A) site identification by the {ERPIN} program and achieved a prediction specificity of 69 to 85\% for a sensitivity of 56\%.


{CONCLUSION}

The availability of complete genomes and large {EST} sequence databases now permit large-scale observation of polyadenylation sites. Both U-rich sequences flanking both sides of poly(A) signals contribute to the definition of "true" sites. However, the downstream U-rich sequences may also play an enhancing role. Based on this information, poly(A) site prediction accuracy was moderately but consistently improved compared to the best previously available algorithm.},

The \~{} 35 region of several Escherichia coli promoters do not have homology with the consensus sequence, but still drive activator independent transcription initiation. This is due to the presence of a {TG} motif upstream from the -10 hexamer creating an {\textquoteleft}extended -10{\textquoteright} promoter. We have previously shown that two {\textquoteleft}extended -10{\textquoteright} promoters, ga/p1 and {pBla}, can form open complexes at lower temperatures than the ga/p1 derivative, ga/Pcon6, which has a consensus - 35 hexamer. Here we report further investigations into the mechanism of open complex formation by {RNA} polymerase, in particular the thermal energy requirement. A single base pair change in ga/pcon6 creating an {\textquoteleft}extended - 10 {\textquoteright} sequence, results in a 20{\textdegree}C reduction in the temperature requirement for open complex formation. The {DNA} topology has also been shown to effect the thermal energy requirement for strand separation. Promoters carried on supercoiled plasmids form open complexes at lower temperatures than when present on linear {DNA} templates. We have also shown that in vivo, {RNA} polymerase can form open complexes at lower temperatures than those observed for linear templates in vitro, but requires slightly higher temperatures than supercoiled templates in vitro, however the promoter hierachy remains the same.},

In this article, we describe a novel algorithm for genome-wide de novo prediction of {CRBSs} with high accuracy. We designed our algorithm to circumvent three identified difficulties for {CRBS} prediction using comparative genomics principles based on a new method for the selection of reference genomes, a new metric for measuring the similarity of {CRBSs}, and a new graph clustering procedure. When operon structures are correctly predicted, our algorithm can predict 81\% of known individual binding sites belonging to 94\% of known cis-regulatory motifs in the Escherichia coli K12 genome, while achieving high prediction specificity. Our algorithm has also achieved similar prediction accuracy in the Bacillus subtilis genome, suggesting that it is very robust, and thus can be applied to any other sequenced prokaryotic genome. When compared with the prior state-of-the-art algorithms, our algorithm outperforms them in both prediction sensitivity and specificity.},

This review highlights (a) the roles of antisigma factors in controlling the availability of alternative sigma factors and (b) the involvement of diverse regulatory molecules that promote the use of alternative sigma factors through subversion of the domineering housekeeping $\sigma$70.

We used this technique to monitor translation in budding yeast under both rich and starvation conditions.

However, the component of {RNA} polymerase recognizing the length of the spacing between hexamers has not been determined. Using an equilibrium {DNA} binding competition assay, we demonstrate that a polypeptide of sigma 70 carrying both {DNA} binding domains is very sensitive to promoter spacing, whereas a sigma 70 polypeptide with only one {DNA} binding domain is not. Furthermore, a mutant sigma, selected for increasing transcription of the minimal lac promoter (18-bp spacer), has an altered response to promoter spacing in vivo and in vitro. Our data support the idea that sigma makes simultaneous, productive contacts at both the -10 and the -35 regions of the promoter and discerns the spacing between these conserved regions.},

Here, we investigated the mechanism of $\sigma$-dependent pausing using reconstituted transcription elongation complexes which allowed highly efficient and precisely controlled pause formation. We demonstrated that, following engagement of the $\sigma$ subunit to the pause site, {RNAP} continues {RNA} synthesis leading to formation of stressed elongation complexes, in which the nascent {RNA} remains resistant to Gre-induced cleavage while the transcription bubble and {RNAP} footprint on the {DNA} template extend in downstream direction, likely accompanied by {DNA} scrunching. The stressed complexes can then either break $\sigma$-mediated contacts and continue elongation or isomerize to a backtracked conformation. Suppressing of the {RNAP} backtracking decreases pausing and increases productive elongation. On the contrary, core {RNAP} mutations that impair {RNAP} interactions with the downstream part of the {DNA} template stimulate pausing, presumably by destabilizing the stressed complexes. We propose that interplay between {DNA} scrunching and {RNAP} backtracking may have an essential role in transcription pausing and its regulation in various systems.},

	abstract = {In Escherichia coli, pyrimidine-mediated regulation of upp expression occurs by {UTP}-sensitive selection of alternative transcriptional start sites, which produces transcripts that differ in the ability to be elongated. The upp initially transcribed region contains the sequence {GATTTTTTTTG} (nontemplate strand). Initiation can occur at either the first or the second base in this sequence (designated G6 and A7, with numbering from the promoter -10 region). High intracellular {UTP} levels favor initiation at position A7; however, the resulting transcripts are subject to reiterative transcription (i.e., repetitive {UMP} addition) within the 8-bp T {\textperiodcentered} A tract in the initially transcribed region and are aborted. In contrast, low intracellular {UTP} levels favor initiation at position G6, which results in transcripts that can, in part, avoid reiterative transcription and be elongated normally. In this study, we examined the regulatory requirement for the long T {\textperiodcentered} A tract in the upp initially transcribed region. We constructed upp promoter mutations that shorten the T {\textperiodcentered} A tract to 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2 bp and examined the effects of these mutations on upp expression and regulation. The results indicate that pyrimidine-mediated regulation is gradually reduced as the T {\textperiodcentered} A tract is shortened from 7 to 3 bp; at which point regulation ceases. This reduction in regulation is due to large-percentage increases in upp expression in cells grown under conditions of pyrimidine excess. Quantitation of cellular transcripts and in vitro transcription studies indicate that the observed effects of a shortened T {\textperiodcentered} A tract on upp expression and regulation are due to increases in the fraction of both G6- and A7-initiated transcripts that avoid reiterative transcription and are elongated normally.},

Here we used antisense morpholino oligonucleotide to U1 {snRNA} to achieve functional U1 {snRNP} knockdown in {HeLa} cells, and identified accumulated unspliced pre-{mRNAs} by genomic tiling microarrays. In addition to inhibiting splicing, U1 {snRNP} knockdown caused premature cleavage and polyadenylation in numerous pre-{mRNAs} at cryptic polyadenylation signals, frequently in introns near ({\textless}5 kilobases) the start of the transcript. This did not occur when splicing was inhibited with U2 {snRNA} antisense morpholino oligonucleotide or the U2-{snRNP}-inactivating drug spliceostatin A unless U1 antisense morpholino oligonucleotide was also included. We further show that U1 {snRNA}{\textendash}pre-{mRNA} base pairing was required to suppress premature cleavage and polyadenylation from nearby cryptic polyadenylation signals located in introns. These findings reveal a critical splicing-independent function for U1 {snRNP} in protecting the transcriptome, which we propose explains its overabundance.

We report direct measurements of individual Escherichia coli {RNAPs} as they transcribed supercoiled {DNA}. We found that a resisting torque slowed {RNAP} and increased its pause frequency and duration. {RNAP} was able to generate 11 {\textpm} 4 piconewton-nanometers (mean {\textpm} standard deviation) of torque before stalling, an amount sufficient to melt {DNA} of arbitrary sequence and establish {RNAP} as a more potent torsional motor than previously known. A stalled {RNAP} was able to resume transcription upon torque relaxation, and transcribing {RNAP} was resilient to transient torque fluctuations. These results provide a quantitative framework for understanding how dynamic modification of {DNA} supercoiling regulates transcription.
Keeping Transcription Going
In cells, the {DNA} double-stranded helix ({dsDNA}) is mostly supercoiled{\textemdash}either under- or overwound. {RNA} polymerase ({RNAP}) must transcribe though this supercoiled {DNA}. Furthermore, the act of transcription, which involves opening the double helix and threading the separated strands through the enzyme, generates supercoiling ahead and behind the polymerase. Ma et al. (p. 1580) used single-molecule methods to measure the upstream and downstream torque forces of Escherichia coli {RNAP}. The upstream torque was sufficient to disrupt {dsDNA} structure, and the stalled {RNAP} could also backtrack along the {DNA}. Release of the torsional stress allowed {RNAP} to resume transcription in vitro.},

	abstract = {The prokaryotic {mRNA} ribosome binding site ({RBS}) usually contains part or all of a polypurine domain {UAAGGAGGU} known as the Shine-Dalgarno ({SD}) sequence found just 5' to the translation initiation codon. It is now clear that the {SD} sequence is important for identification of the translation initiation site on the {mRNA} by the ribosome, and that as a result, the spacing between the {SD} and the initiation codon strongly affects translational efficiency (1). It is not as clear, however, whether there is a unique optimal spacing. Complications involving the definition of the spacing as well as secondary structures have obscured matters. We thus undertook a systematic study by inserting two series of synthetic {RBSs} of varying spacing and {SD} sequence into a plasmid vector containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Care was taken not to introduce any secondary structure. Measurements of protein expression demonstrated an optimal aligned spacing of 5 nt for both series. Since aligned spacing corresponds naturally to the spacing between the 3'-end of the 16S {rRNA} and the P-site, we conclude that there is a unique optimal aligned {SD}-{AUG} spacing in the absence of other complicating issues.},

This requires initial contacts between {mRNA}, {fMet}-{tRNA} and the 30S subunit of the ribosome, steps that limit the initiation of translation. Here we report a method for improving translational initiation, which allows expression of several previously non-expressible genes. This method has potential applications in heterologous protein synthesis and high-throughput expression systems. We introduced a synthetic {RNA} stem-loop (stem length, 7 bp; \{Delta\}G0 = -9.9 kcal/mol) in front of various gene sequences. In each case, the stem-loop was inserted 15 nt downstream from the start codon. Insertion of the stem-loop allowed in vitro expression of five previously non-expressible genes and enhanced the expression of all other genes investigated. Analysis of the {RNA} structure proved that the stem-loop was formed in vitro, and demonstrated that stabilization of the ribosome binding site is due to stem-loop introduction. By theoretical {RNA} structure analysis we showed that the inserted {RNA} stem-loop suppresses long-range interactions between the translation initiation domain and gene-specific {mRNA} sequences. Thus the inserted {RNA} stem-loop supports the formation of a separate translational initiation domain, which is more accessible to ribosome binding.},

	abstract = {Over the last two decades, a large amount of data on initiation of transcription by bacterial {RNA} polymerase ({RNAP}) has been obtained. However, a question of how the open complex is formed still remains open, and several qualitative hypotheses for opening of {DNA} by {RNAP} have been proposed. To provide a theoretical framework needed to analyze the assembled experimental data, we here develop the first quantitative model of the open complex formation by bacterial {RNAP}. We first show that a simple hypothesis (which might follow from recent bioinformatic and experimental results), by which promoter {DNA} is melted in one step through thermal fluctuations, is inconsistent with experimental data. We next consider a more complex two-step view of the open complex formation. According to this hypothesis, the transcription bubble is formed in the -10 region, and consequently extends to the transcription start site. We derive how the open complex formation rate depends on {DNA} duplex melting energy and on interaction energies of {RNAP} with promoter {DNA} in the closed and open complex. This relationship provides an explicit connection between transcription initiation rate and physical properties of the promoter sequence and promoter-{RNAP} interactions. We compare our model with both biochemical measurements and genomics data and report a very good agreement with the experiments, with no free parameters used in model testing. This agreement therefore strongly supports both the quantitative model that we propose and the qualitative hypothesis on which the model is based. From a practical point, our results allow efficient estimation of promoter kinetic parameters, as well as engineering of promoter sequences with the desired kinetic properties.},

 secondary structures during quenched or sequential folding. For the
 hepatitis delta virus ribozyme, we predict several nonnative stems on
 the folding path, characterize a kinetically trapped state, interpret
 several experimentally characterized mutations in terms of the folding

For melting simulations, the package computes entire melting profiles, not just melting temperatures. {UV} absorbance at 260 nm, heat capacity change (C(p)), and mole fractions of different molecular species are computed as a function of temperature. The package installs and runs on all Unix and Linux platforms that we have looked at, including Mac {OS} X. Images of secondary structures, hybridizations, and dot plots may be computed using common formats. Similarly, a variety of melting profile plots is created when appropriate. These latter plots include experimental results if they are provided. The package is "command line" driven. Underlying compiled programs may be used individually, or in special combinations through the use of a variety of Perl scripts. Users are encouraged to create their own scripts to supplement what comes with the package.

The current work focuses on the transition from an initially transcribing, promoter-bound complex to an elongation complex clear of the promoter. Fluorescence quenching is used to follow the melted state of the {DNA} bubble, and a novel approach using a locally mismatched fluorescent base analog reports on the local structure of the heteroduplex. Fluorescent base analogs placed at positions [-]2 and [-]1 of the promoter indicate that this initially melted, nontranscribed region remains melted as the polymerase translocates through to position +8. In progressing to position +9, this region of the {DNA} bubble begins to collapse. Probes placed at positions +1 and +2 of the template strand indicate that the 5' end of the {RNA} remains in a heteroduplex as the complex translocates to position +10. Subsequent translocation leads to sequential dissociation of the first 2 bases of the {RNA}. These results show that the initially transcribing complex bubble can reach a size of up to 13 base pairs and a maximal heteroduplex length of 10 base pairs. They further indicate that initial bubble collapse precedes dissociation of the 5' end of the {RNA}.},

We now report a similar intronic polyadenylation mechanism for the human {GART} locus. The human {GART} gene has two potential polyadenylation signals within the identically located intron as that involved in intronic polyadenylation in the mouse gene. Each of the potential polyadenylation signals in the human gene was followed by an extensive {polyT} rich tract, but only the downstream signal was preceded by a {GT} tract. Only the downstream signal was utilized. The {polyT} rich tract which followed the functional polyadenylation site in the human {GART} gene was virtually identical in sequence to a similarly placed region in the mouse gene. An exact inverted complement to the {polyT} rich stretch following the active polyadenylation signal was found in the upstream intron of the human gene, suggesting that a hairpin loop may be involved in this intronic polyadenylation.},

	abstract = {Tandem 3' {UTRs} produced by alternative polyadenylation ({APA}) play an important role in gene expression by impacting {mRNA} stability, translation, and translocation in cells. Several studies have investigated {APA} site switching in various physiological states; nevertheless, they only focused on either the genes with two known {APA} sites or several candidate genes. Here, we developed a strategy to study {APA} sites in a genome-wide fashion with second-generation sequencing technology which could not only identify new polyadenylation sites but also analyze the {APA} site switching of all genes, especially those with more than two {APA} sites. We used this strategy to explore the profiling of {APA} sites in two human breast cancer cell lines, {MCF}7 and {MB}231, and one cultured mammary epithelial cell line, {MCF}10A. More than half of the identified polyadenylation sites are not included in human poly(A) databases. While {MCF}7 showed shortening 3' {UTRs}, more genes in {MB}231 switched to distal poly(A) sites. Several gene ontology ({GO}) terms and pathways were enriched in the list of genes with switched {APA} sites, including cell cycle, apoptosis, and metabolism. These results suggest a more complex regulation of {APA} sites in cancer cells than previously thought. In short, our novel unbiased method can be a powerful approach to cost-effectively investigate the complex mechanism of 3' {UTR} switching in a genome-wide fashion among various physiological processes and diseases.},

Moreover, based on several lines of experimental evidence, translocation, pyrophosphate release or an associated conformational change may determine the transcription elongation rate. In this review we discuss various models of translocation, the data supporting the hypothesis that translocation rate determines transcription elongation rate and also data that may be inconsistent with this point of view. A model of the nucleotide addition cycle accommodating available experimental data is proposed.

This global regulation is controlled by alternative polyadenylation and coordinates with initiation of organogenesis and aspects of embryonic development, including morphogenesis, differentiation, and proliferation. Using myogenesis of C2C12 myoblast cells as a model, we recapitulated this process in vitro and found that 3' {UTR} lengthening is likely caused by weakening of {mRNA} polyadenylation activity. Because alternative 3' {UTR} sequences are typically longer and have higher {AU} content than constitutive ones, our results suggest that lengthening of 3' {UTR} can significantly augment posttranscriptional control of gene expression during embryonic development, such as {microRNA}-mediated regulation.},

The genetic code is degenerate. Each amino acid is encoded by up to six synonymous codons; the choice between these codons influences gene expression. Here, we show that in coding sequences, once a particular codon has been used, subsequent occurrences of the same amino acid do not use codons randomly, but favor codons that use the same {tRNA}. The effect is pronounced in rapidly induced genes, involves both frequent and rare codons and diminishes only slowly as a function of the distance between subsequent synonymous codons. Furthermore, we found that in S. cerevisiae codon correlation accelerates translation relative to the translation of synonymous yet anticorrelated sequences. The data suggest that {tRNA} diffusion away from the ribosome is slower than translation, and that some {tRNA} channeling takes place at the ribosome. They also establish that the dynamics of translation leave a significant signature at the level of the genome.},

To investigate the prevalence of such intermediates, we screened 118 Escherichia coli candidate promoters for {RNAP} stalling at or near the promoter, using in vivo {KMnO}4 mapping of {RNAP} on chromosomal {DNA}. Of 34 active promoters, the seven preceding {lacZ}, {tnaA}, {cspA}, {cspD}, {rplK}, {rpsA} and {rpsU} harboured stalled {RNAP} in vivo; this finding suggests that {RNAP} stalling after initiation is widespread in E. coli. Consistent with the characteristics of both abortive and promoter-proximal 03C370-dependent paused complexes, {RNAP} trapping at most of the newly identified stall sites was eliminated by the {rpoDL}402F03C370 mutational alteration and by site mutations, and was enhanced by {GreA} deficiency. In addition to promoter-proximal {RNAP} trapping, we observed transcription-dependent {DNA} modifications spanning the {tnaA} and {cspA} leader regions up to 100~bp downstream of the transcription start site.},

	abstract = {Background
The generation and analysis of high-throughput sequencing data are becoming a major component of many studies in molecular biology and medical research. Illumina's Genome Analyzer ({GA}) and {HiSeq} instruments are currently the most widely used sequencing devices. Here, we comprehensively evaluate properties of genomic {HiSeq} and {GAIIx} data derived from two plant genomes and one virus, with read lengths of 95 to 150 bases.

Results
We provide quantifications and evidence for {GC} bias, error rates, error sequence context, effects of quality filtering, and the reliability of quality values. By combining different filtering criteria we reduced error rates 7-fold at the expense of discarding 12.5\% of alignable bases. While overall error rates are low in {HiSeq} data we observed regions of accumulated wrong base calls. Only 3\% of all error positions accounted for 24.7\% of all substitution errors. Analyzing the forward and reverse strands separately revealed error rates of up to 18.7\%. Insertions and deletions occurred at very low rates on average but increased to up to 2\% in homopolymers. A positive correlation between read coverage and {GC} content was found depending on the {GC} content range.

Conclusions
The errors and biases we report have implications for the use and the interpretation of Illumina sequencing data. {GAIIx} and {HiSeq} data sets show slightly different error profiles. Quality filtering is essential to minimize downstream analysis artifacts. Supporting previous recommendations, the strand-specificity provides a criterion to distinguish sequencing errors from low abundance polymorphisms.},

	abstract = {Translational efficiency in Escherichia coli is known to be strongly influenced by the secondary structure around the ribosome-binding site and the initiation codon in the translational-initiation region of the {mRNA}. Several quantitative studies have reported that translational efficiency is attributable to effects on ribosome accessibility predominantly caused by the secondary structure surrounding the ribosome-binding site. However, the influence of {mRNA} secondary structure around regions downstream of the initiation codon on translational efficiency after ribosome-binding step has not been quantitatively studied. Here, we quantitatively analyzed the relationship between secondary structure of {mRNA} surrounding the region downstream of the initiation codon, referred to as the downstream region ({DR}), and protein expression levels. Modified hairpin structures containing the initiation codon were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, and their effects on expression were analyzed in vivo. The minimal folding free energy ({DeltaG}) of a local hairpin structure was found to be linearly correlated with the relative expression level over a range of fourfold change. These results demonstrate that expression level can be quantitatively controlled by changing the stability of the secondary structure surrounding the {DR}. Biotechnol.

It is one of the most subtle and pervasive forces of molecular evolution, yet, establishing the underlying causes for its idiosyncratic behaviour across living kingdoms has proven elusive to researchers over the past 20 years. In this study, a statistical model for measuring translational selection in any given genome is developed, and the test is applied to 126 fully sequenced genomes, ranging from archaea to eukaryotes. It is shown that {tRNA} gene redundancy and genome size are interacting forces that ultimately determine the action of translational selection, and that an optimal genome size exists for which this kind of selection is maximal. Accordingly, genome size also presents upper and lower boundaries beyond which selection on codon usage is not possible. We propose a model where the coevolution of genome size and {tRNA} genes explains the observed patterns in translational selection in all living organisms. This model finally unifies our understanding of codon usage across prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Helicobacter pylori, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens are codon usage paradigms that can be better understood under the proposed model.},

In contrast, it was recently proposed that the first complex cells, which were actually proto-eukaryotes, arose simultaneously with the acquisition of mitochondria. This so-called symbiotic association hypothesis states that eukaryotes emerged when some ancient anaerobic archaebacteria (hosts) engulfed respiring alpha-proteobacteria (symbionts), which evolved into the first energy-producing organelles. Therefore, the intracellular compartmentalization of the energy-converting metabolism that was bound originally to the plasma membrane appears to be the key innovation towards eukaryotic genome and cellular organization. The novel energy metabolism made it possible for the nucleotide synthetic apparatus of cells to be no longer limited by subsaturation with substrates and catalytic components. As a consequence, a considerable increase has occurred in the size and complexity of eukaryotic genomes, providing the genetic basis for most of the further evolutionary changes in cellular complexity. On the other hand, the active uptake of exogenous {DNA}, which is general in bacteria, was no longer essential in the genome organization of eukaryotes. The mitochondrion-driven scenario for the first eukaryotes explains the chimera-like composition of eukaryotic genomes as well as the metabolic and cellular organization of eukaryotes.},

We present an in vitro investigation on the ligand-induced folding process of the {preQ}1 responsive {RNA} element from Fusobacterium nucleatum using biophysical methods, including fluorescence and {NMR} spectroscopy of site-specifically labeled riboswitch variants. We provide evidence that the full-length riboswitch domain adopts two different coexisting stem-loop structures in the expression platform.

This system therefore, represents a finely tunable antiterminator/terminator interplay that impacts the in vivo cellular response mechanism.

	abstract = {The mechanism of initiation of translation differs between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and the strategies used for regulation differ accordingly. Translation in prokaryotes is usually regulated by blocking access to the initiation site. This is accomplished via base-paired structures (within the {mRNA} itself, or between the {mRNA} and a small trans-acting {RNA}) or via {mRNA}-binding proteins. Classic examples of each mechanism are described. The polycistronic structure of {mRNAs} is an important aspect of translational control in prokaryotes, but polycistronic {mRNAs} are not usable (and usually not produced) in eukaryotes. Four structural elements in eukaryotic {mRNAs} are important for regulating translation: (i) the m7G cap; (ii) sequences flanking the {AUG} start codon; (iii) the position of the {AUG} codon relative to the 5' end of the {mRNA}; and (iv) secondary structure within the {mRNA} leader sequence. The scanning model provides a framework for understanding these effects. The scanning mechanism also explains how small open reading frames near the 5' end of the {mRNA} can down-regulate translation. This constraint is sometimes abrogated by changing the structure of the {mRNA}, sometimes with clinical consequences. Examples are described. Some mistaken ideas about regulation of translation that have found their way into textbooks are pointed out and corrected.},

	abstract = {Biological organisms exist over a broad temperature range of -15{\textdegree}C to~+120{\textdegree}C, where many molecular processes involving {DNA} depend on the nanoscale properties of the double helix. Here, we present results of extensive molecular dynamics simulations of {DNA} oligomers at different temperatures. We show that internal basepair conformations are strongly temperature-dependent, particularly in the stretch and opening degrees of freedom whose harmonic fluctuations can be considered the initial steps of the {DNA} melting pathway. The basepair step elasticity contains a weaker, but detectable, entropic contribution in the roll, tilt, and rise degrees of freedom. To extend the validity of our results to the temperature interval beyond the standard melting transition relevant to extremophiles, we estimate the effects of superhelical stress on the stability of the basepair steps, as computed from the Benham model. We predict that although the average twist decreases with temperature in~vitro, the stabilizing external torque in~vivo results in an increase of \~{}1{\textdegree}/bp (or a superhelical density of $\Delta$ $\sigma$ ? + 0.03 ) in the interval 0{\textendash}100{\textdegree}C. In the final step, we show that the experimentally observed apparent bending persistence length of torsionally unconstrained {DNA} can be calculated from a hybrid model that accounts for the softening of the double helix and the presence of transient denaturation bubbles. Although the latter dominate the behavior close to the melting transition, the inclusion of helix softening is important around standard physiological temperatures.},

Biochemical and genetic studies to date have shown that Escherichia coli Gre factors prevent transcriptional arrest during elongation and enhance transcription fidelity. Furthermore, Gre factors participate in the stimulation of promoter escape and the suppression of promoter-proximal pausing during the beginning of {RNA} synthesis in E. coli. Although Gre factors are conserved in general bacteria, limited functional studies have been performed in bacteria other than E. coli. In this investigation, {ChAP}-chip analysis (chromatin affinity precipitation coupled with {DNA} microarray) was conducted to visualize the distribution of Bacillus subtilis {GreA} on the chromosome and to determine the effects of {GreA} inactivation on core {RNAP} trafficking. Our data show that {GreA} is uniformly distributed in the transcribed region from the promoter to coding region with core {RNAP}, and its inactivation induces {RNAP} accumulation at many promoter or promoter-proximal regions. Based on these findings, we propose that {GreA} would constantly associate with core {RNAP} during transcriptional initiation and elongation and resolves its stalling at promoter or promoter-proximal regions, thus contributing to the even distribution of {RNAP} along the promoter and coding regions in B. subtilis cells.},

In this study, using experimental {mRNA} expression and protein abundance data collected from Desulfovibrio vulgaris by {DNA} microarray and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry ({LC}{\textendash}{MS}/{MS}) proteomic analysis, we quantitatively examined the effects of several translational-efficiency-related sequence features on {mRNA}{\textendash}protein correlation. Three classes of sequence features were investigated according to different translational stages: (i) initiation, Shine{\textendash}Dalgarno sequences, start codon identity, and start codon context; (ii) elongation, codon usage and amino acid usage; and (iii) termination, stop codon identity and stop codon context. Surprisingly, although it is widely accepted that translation initiation is the rate-limiting step for translation, our results showed that the {mRNA}{\textendash}protein correlation was affected the most by the features at elongation stages, i.e., codon usage and amino acid composition (5.3{\textendash}15.7\% and 5.8{\textendash}11.9\% of the total variation of {mRNA}{\textendash}protein correlation, respectively), followed by stop codon context and the Shine{\textendash}Dalgarno sequence (3.7{\textendash}5.1\% and 1.9{\textendash}3.8\%, respectively).

Most of the focus of studies of sequence variation is on single nucleotide variants ({SNVs}) and large structural variants. In principle, high-throughput sequencing studies should allow identification of indels just as {SNVs}. However, inference of indels from next-generation sequence data is challenging, and so far methods for identifying indels lag behind methods for calling {SNVs} in terms of sensitivity and specificity. We propose a Bayesian method to call indels from short-read sequence data in individuals and populations by realigning reads to candidate haplotypes that represent alternative sequence to the reference. The candidate haplotypes are formed by combining candidate indels and {SNVs} identified by the read mapper, while allowing for known sequence variants or candidates from other methods to be included. In our probabilistic realignment model we account for base-calling errors, mapping errors, and also, importantly, for increased sequencing error indel rates in long homopolymer runs. We show that our method is sensitive and achieves low false discovery rates on simulated and real data sets, although challenges remain. The algorithm is implemented in the program Dindel, which has been used in the 1000 Genomes Project call sets.},

Although the modification of promoters demonstrates the great impact on the translation efficiency, it is difficult to detect the proper variants required for tunable expression. The 5'-untranslated region ({UTR}), however, can be an important target for tunable expressions because the ribosome binding affinity is directly modulated by the sequence variants of the Shine-Dalgarno ({SD}) sequence and the {AU}-rich sequence, which are the ribosome binding sites and a {SD}-sequence-independent translation enhancer, respectively. This study developed a simple method to obtain numerous 5'-{UTR} variants and analyze their translation efficiency based on the {PCR}-based site-directed mutagenesis and the expressional {PCR} using coupled in vitro transcription/translation system derived from Escherichia coli and {eGFP} gene as a template. {SD} sequence variants (18) and {AU}-rich sequence variants (36), which have a wide range of relative expression levels ranging from 0.1 to 2.0, were obtained.

	abstract = {5'- and 3'-untranslated regions ({UTRs}) are important regulators of gene expression and play key roles in disease progression and susceptibility. The 5'-{UTR} of the fragile X mental retardation 1 ({FMR}1) gene contains a {CGG} repeat element that is expanded ({\textgreater}200 {CGG} repeats; full mutation) and methylated in fragile X syndrome ({FXS}), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability ({ID}) and known cause of autism. Significant phenotypic involvement has also emerged in some individuals with the premutation (55{\textendash}200 {CGG} repeats), including fragile X-associated premature ovarian insufficiency ({FXPOI}) in females, and the neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome ({FXTAS}), in older adult carriers. Here, we show that {FMR}1 {mRNA} in human and mouse brain is expressed as a combination of multiple isoforms that use alternative transcriptional start sites and different polyadenylation sites. Furthermore, we have identified a novel human transcription start site used in brain but not in lymphoblastoid cells, and have detected {FMR}1 isoforms generated through the use of both canonical and non-canonical polyadenylation signals. Importantly, in both human and mouse, a specific regulation of the {UTRs} is observed in brain of {FMR}1 premutation alleles, suggesting that the transcript variants may play a role in premutation-related pathologies.},

	abstract = {Summary
In cancer cells, genetic alterations can activate proto-oncogenes, thereby contributing to tumorigenesis. However, the protein products of oncogenes are sometimes overexpressed without alteration of the proto-oncogene. Helping to explain this phenomenon, we found that when compared to similarly proliferating nontransformed cell lines, cancer cell lines often expressed substantial amounts of {mRNA} isoforms with shorter 3' untranslated regions ({UTRs}). These shorter isoforms usually resulted from alternative cleavage and polyadenylation ({APA}). The {APA} had functional consequences, with the shorter {mRNA} isoforms exhibiting increased stability and typically producing ten-fold more protein, in part through the loss of {microRNA}-mediated repression. Moreover, expression of the shorter {mRNA} isoform of the proto-oncogene {IGF}2BP1/{IMP}-1 led to far more oncogenic transformation than did expression of the full-length, annotated {mRNA}. The high incidence of {APA} in cancer cells, with consequent loss of 3'{UTR} repressive elements, suggests a pervasive role for {APA} in oncogene activation without genetic alteration.},

	abstract = {The properties of the {DNA} bubble in the transcription open complex have been characterized by topological analysis of {DNA} circles containing the lac {UV}5 promoter or the {PR} promoter from bacteriophage lambda. Topological analysis is particularly well suited to this purpose since it quantifies the changes in {DNA} duplex geometry caused by bubble formation as well as by superhelical {DNA} wrapping. The duplex unwinding that results from bubble formation is detected as a reduction in topological linking number of the {DNA} circle, and the precision of this measurement has been enhanced in the current study through the use of 8 or 10 promoter copies per circle. Several lines of evidence indicate that the linking number change induced by open complex formation is essentially all due to bubble generation, with very little derived from superhelical wrapping. Accordingly, the linking number change of 1.17 measured for the lac {UV}5 promoter indicates that the size of the lac {UV}5 bubble is about 12.3 base pairs, while the change of 0.98 measured for the lambda {PR} promoter indicates that the lambda {PR} bubble is 10.3 base pairs. It was also found that the presence or absence of magnesium ion had little effect on the value of the linking number change, a result that resolves the uncertainty associated with use of chemical probes to study the effect of magnesium on bubble size. Finally, the magnitude of linking number change increases progressively when the 3` end of a transcript is extended to +2 and +3 in an abortive initiation complex. This indicates that the transcription bubble expands at its leading edge in the abortive complex, results that confirm and extend the proposal of a {DNA} scrunching mechanism at the onset of transcription. These results are relevant to several models for the structure of {DNA} in the functional open complex in solution, and provide an important complement to the structural information available from recent crystal structures.},

The disparate stabilities of bacterial messages in vivo are a consequence of their differential susceptibility to degradation by cellular endoribonucleases and 3'-exoribonucleases, which in turn results from differences in {mRNA} sequence and structure. {RNase} {II} and polynucleotide phosphorylase, the major bacterial exonucleases involved in {mRNA} turnover, rapidly degrade single-stranded {RNA} from the 3' end, but are impeded by 3' stem-loop structures. At present, the identity and substrate specificity of the endonucleases that control {mRNA} decay rates are relatively poorly defined. Ribosomes and antisense {RNA} also can influence the stability of transcripts with which they associate. Differences in {mRNA} stability can contribute to differential expression of genes within polycistronic operons and to modulation of gene expression in response to changes in bacterial growth conditions.},

A laser-induced temperature jump is used to initiate a perturbation in the {RNA} structure. A probe laser, tuned to a specific infrared absorption of the {RNA}, is then used to monitor the subsequent relaxation kinetics. A 10-ns pump pulse permits the investigation of fast, nanosecond events. In this work we probe two vibrational transitions, one at 1620\&\#xa0;cm-1 and one at 1661\&\#xa0;cm-1. The former transition reports mainly on the dynamics of A and U interactions, the latter is attributed to mainly G and C interactions. Our results reveal three distinct kinetic phases for each vibrational transition probed. We propose two models to describe the data. In one mechanism, the unfolded state partitions into two separate populations; each is conformationally biased to proceed via one of two distinct pathways. In an alternative model, folding proceeds through a series of sequentially populated intermediates. In both cases, the first step in the proposed folding mechanism is rate limiting (hundreds of microseconds) and involves a collapse into incorrectly folded intermediate populations. Two faster kinetic phases (tens of microseconds and hundreds of nanoseconds) follow in which the intermediate populations undergo localized reorganizational motions in the search for native contacts.},

In all kingdoms of life, transcription must be finely tuned to ensure an appropriate balance between fidelity and speed. Here, we used an optical-trapping assay with high spatiotemporal resolution to probe directly the motion of individual {RNAPII} molecules as they pass through each of the enzymatic steps of transcript elongation. We report direct evidence that the {RNAPII} trigger loop, an evolutionarily conserved protein subdomain, serves as a master regulator of transcription, affecting each of the three main phases of elongation, namely: substrate selection, translocation, and catalysis. Global fits to the force-velocity relationships of {RNAPII} and its trigger loop mutants support a Brownian ratchet model for elongation, where the incoming {NTP} is able to bind in either the pre- or posttranslocated state, and movement between these two states is governed by the trigger loop. Comparison of the kinetics of pausing by {WT} and mutant {RNAPII} under conditions that promote base misincorporation indicate that the trigger loop governs fidelity in substrate selection and mismatch recognition, and thereby controls aspects of both transcriptional accuracy and rate.},

Recent studies of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic transcription have yielded an increasing appreciation of the extent to which gene regulation is accomplished during the elongation phase of transcription. Transcriptional pausing is a fundamental enzymatic mechanism that underlies many of these regulatory schemes. In some cases, pausing functions by halting {RNAP} for times or at positions required for regulatory interactions. In other cases, pauses function by making {RNAP} susceptible to premature termination of transcription unless the enzyme is modified by elongation regulators that programme efficient gene expression. Pausing appears to occur by a two-tiered mechanism in which an initial rearrangement of the enzyme's active site interrupts active elongation and puts {RNAP} in an elemental pause state from which additional rearrangements or regulator interactions can create long-lived pauses. Recent findings from biochemical and single-molecule transcription experiments, coupled with the invaluable availability of {RNAP} crystal structures, have produced attractive hypotheses to explain the fundamental mechanism of pausing.},

In the paused complexes, the nascent {RNAs} form labile structures that sequester these upstream portions in a manner to possibly guide folding. Both the pause sites and the secondary structure of the nonnative portions of the paused complexes are phylogenetically conserved among $\gamma$-proteobacteria. We propose that specific pausing-induced structural formation is a general strategy to facilitate the folding of long-range helices. This polymerase-based mechanism may result in portions of noncoding {RNA} sequences being evolutionarily conserved for efficient folding during transcription.},

Using novel statistical approaches, we evaluated the coverage of annotated features of the genome and of candidate processed transcripts, including splice junctions, trans-spliced leader sequences, and polyadenylation tracts. The data provide experimental support for {\textgreater}85\% of the annotated protein-coding transcripts in {WormBase} ({WS}170) and confirm additional details of processing. For example, the total number of confirmed splice junctions was raised from 70,911 to over 98,000. The data also suggest thousands of modifications to {WormBase} annotations and identify new spliced junctions and genes not part of any {WormBase} annotation, including at least 80 putative genes not found in any of three predicted gene sets. The quantitative nature of the data also suggests that {mRNA} levels may be measured by this approach with unparalleled precision. Although most sequences align with protein-coding genes, a small fraction falls in introns and intergenic regions. One notable region on the X chromosome encodes a noncoding transcript of {\textgreater}10 kb localized to somatic nuclei.},

The deletion had multiple effects on transcription initiation including: (i) a significant decrease in the amount of short abortive {RNAs} synthesized during initiation, (ii) defects in promoter escape, (iii) loss of the contacts between the $\sigma$ subunit and the nascent {RNA} during initiation and, finally, (iv) dramatic increase in the Km value for the 3'-initiating nucleotide.

In {RNA} the two levels of folding (secondary and tertiary) can be experimentally separated by the presence or absence of Mg2+. Secondary structure can be predicted successfully from experimental thermodynamic data on secondary structure elements: helices, loops, and bulges. Tertiary interactions can then be added without much distortion of the secondary structure. These observations suggest a folding algorithm to predict the structure of an {RNA} from its sequence. However, to solve the {RNA} folding problem one needs thermodynamic data on tertiary structure interactions, and identification and characterization of metal-ion binding sites.

The energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate is utilized in biochemical cycles, transport processes, protein synthesis, reproduction, and performing other biological work. The processes in molecular and cellular biological systems are stochastic in nature with varying spatial and time scales, and bounded with conservation laws, kinetic laws, and thermodynamic constraints, which should be taken into account by any approach for modeling biological systems. In component biology, this review focuses on the modeling of enzyme kinetics and fluctuation of single biomolecules acting as molecular motors, while in systems biology it focuses on modeling biochemical cycles and networks in which all the components of a biological system interact functionally over time and space. Biochemical cycles emerge from collective and functional efforts to devise a cyclic flow of optimal energy degradation rate, which can only be described by nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Therefore, this review emphasizes the role of nonequilibrium thermodynamics through the formulations of thermodynamically coupled biochemical cycles, entropy production, fluctuation theorems, bioenergetics, and reaction-diffusion systems. Fluctuation theorems relate the forward and backward dynamical randomness of the trajectories or paths, bridge the microscopic and macroscopic domains, and link the time-reversible and irreversible descriptions of biological systems. However, many of these approaches are in their early stages of their development and no single computational or experimental technique is able to span all the relevant and necessary spatial and temporal scales. Wide range of experimental and novel computational techniques with high accuracy, precision, coverage, and efficiency are necessary for understanding biochemical cycles.},

This function depends on specific intersubunit interactions that occur when $\sigma$ associates with the {RNAP} core enzyme to form {RNAP} holoenzyme. Among these interactions, that between conserved region 4 of $\sigma$ and the flap domain of the {RNAP} $\beta$-subunit ($\beta$-flap) is critical for recognition of the major class of bacterial promoters. Here, we describe the isolation of amino acid substitutions in region 4 of Escherichia coli $\sigma$70 that have specific effects on the $\sigma$70 region 4/$\beta$-flap interaction, either weakening or strengthening it. Using these $\sigma$70 mutants, we demonstrate that the $\sigma$ region 4/$\beta$-flap interaction also can affect events occurring downstream of transcription initiation during early elongation. Specifically, our results provide support for a structure-based proposal that, when bound to the $\beta$-flap, $\sigma$ region 4 presents a barrier to the extension of the nascent {RNA} as it emerges from the {RNA} exit channel. Our findings support the view that the transition from initiation to elongation involves a staged disruption of $\sigma$-core interactions.

	abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate ({FWER}). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the {FWER} when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the {FWER} is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Abstract shape analysis allows efficient computation of a representative sample of low-energy foldings of an {RNA} molecule. More comprehensive information is obtained by computing shape probabilities, accumulating the Boltzmann probabilities of all structures within each abstract shape. Such information is superior to free energies because it is independent of sequence length and base composition. However, up to this point, computation of shape probabilities evaluates all shapes simultaneously and comes with a computation cost which is exponential in the length of the sequence. Results: We device an approach called {RapidShapes} that computes the shapes above a specified probability threshold T by generating a list of promising shapes and constructing specialized folding programs for each shape to compute its share of Boltzmann probability. This aims at a heuristic improvement of runtime, while still computing exact probability values. Conclusion: Evaluating this approach and several substrategies, we find that only a small proportion of shapes have to be actually computed. For an {RNA} sequence of length 400, this leads, depending on the threshold, to a 10-138 fold speed-up compared with the previous complete method. Thus, probabilistic shape analysis has become feasible in medium-scale applications, such as the screening of {RNA} transcripts in a bacterial genome.

However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner.
Results: This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data ({BED}) and General Feature Format ({GFF}) format. {BEDTools} also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in {BAM} format to both {BED} and {GFF} features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. {BEDTools} can be combined with one another as well as with standard {UNIX} commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.

Chimeric and mutant promoters were made by swapping sequences between the human interleukin-2 promoter and the adenovirus major late promoter, which exhibit different rates of transcript synthesis. Kinetic studies at these promoters revealed that sequences downstream of the start sites set the rate of transcript synthesis. Specifically, the sequences at +2 and +7/+8 are critical for determining the rate; when either +2 is a C (nontemplate strand) or +7/+8 is a {TT} (nontemplate strand), transcript synthesis is slow. At +7/+8, the thermodynamic stability of the {RNA}:{DNA} hybrid controls the overall rate of transcript synthesis. Our data support a model in which the rate-limiting step during transcript synthesis by {RNA} polymerase {II} in vitro occurs at the point in the reaction at which early ternary complexes transform into elongation complexes.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Transcription slippage occurs on certain patterns of repeat mononucleotides, resulting in synthesis of a heterogeneous population of {mRNAs}. Individual {mRNA} molecules within this population differ in the number of nucleotides they contain that are not specified by the template. When transcriptional slippage occurs in a coding sequence, translation of the resulting {mRNAs} yields more than one protein product. Except where the products of the resulting {mRNAs} have distinct functions, transcription slippage occurring in a coding region is expected to be disadvantageous. This probably leads to selection against most slippage-prone sequences in coding regions.{RESULTS}:To find a length at which such selection is evident, we analyzed the distribution of repetitive runs of A and T of different lengths in 108 bacterial genomes. This length varies significantly among different bacteria, but in a large proportion of available genomes corresponds to nine nucleotides. Comparative sequence analysis of these genomes was used to identify occurrences of 9A and 9T transcriptional slippage-prone sequences used for gene expression.{CONCLUSIONS}:{IS} element genes are the largest group found to exploit this phenomenon. A number of genes with disrupted open reading frames ({ORFs}) have slippage-prone sequences at which transcriptional slippage would result in uninterrupted {ORF} restoration at the {mRNA} level. The ability of such genes to encode functional full-length protein products brings into question their annotation as pseudogenes and in these cases is pertinent to the significance of the term 'authentic frameshift' frequently assigned to such genes.},

Accurate prediction of {DNA} secondary structure and hybridization using dynamic programming algorithms requires a database of thermodynamic parameters for several motifs including Watson-Crick base pairs, internal mismatches, terminal mismatches, terminal dangling ends, hairpins, bulges, internal loops, and multibranched loops. To make the database useful for predictions under a variety of salt conditions, empirical equations for monovalent and magnesium dependence of thermodynamics have been developed. Bimolecular hybridization is often inhibited by competing unimolecular folding of a target or probe {DNA}. Powerful numerical methods have been developed to solve multistate-coupled equilibria in bimolecular and higher-order complexes. This review presents the current parameter set available for making accurate {DNA} structure predictions and also points to future directions for improvement.},

Because {rRNA} promoters contain sequences within the discriminator region that are suboptimal for interaction with $\sigma$1.2, these promoters have the kinetic properties required for regulation by the {RNAP}-binding factors {DksA} and {ppGpp}.

Our studies indicate that nontemplate strand bases adjacent to the -10 element bind within a 9-aa interval in $\sigma$1.2 (residues 99{\textendash}107).

Thermal fluctuations lead to infrequent events of the Watson-Crick basepair opening, or {DNA} {\textquotedblleft}breathing{\textquotedblright}, thus making normally buried groups available for modification and interaction with proteins. Fluctuational basepair opening implies the disruption of hydrogen bonds between the complementary bases and flipping of the base out of the helical stack. Prediction of sequence-dependent basepair opening probabilities in {DNA} is based on separation of the two major contributions to the stability of the double helix: lateral pairing between the complementary bases and stacking of the pairs along the helical axis. The partition function calculates the basepair opening probability at every position based on the loss of two stacking interactions and one basepairing. Our model also includes a term accounting for the unfavorable positioning of the exposed base, which proceeds through a formation of a highly constrained small loop, or a ring. Quantitatively, the ring factor is found as an adjustable parameter from the comparison of the theoretical basepair opening probabilities and the experimental data on short {DNA} duplexes measured by {NMR} spectroscopy.

In this study, we show that abortive initiation affects termination in transcription of bacteriophage T7 gene 10. Specifically, abortive transcripts produced from promoter $\phi$10 exert trans-acting antitermination activity on terminator T$\phi$ both in vitro and in vivo. Following abortive initiation cycling of T7 {RNA} polymerase at $\phi$10, short G-rich and oligo(G) {RNAs} were produced and both specifically sequestered 5- and 6-nt C + U stretch sequences, consequently interfering with terminator hairpin formation. This antitermination activity depended on sequence-specific hybridization of abortive transcripts with the 5' but not 3' half of T$\phi$ {RNA}. Antitermination was abolished when T$\phi$ was mutated to lack a C + U stretch, but restored when abortive transcript sequence was additionally modified to complement the mutation in T$\phi$, both in vitro and in vivo. Antitermination was enhanced in vivo when the abortive transcript concentration was increased via overproduction of {RNA} polymerase or ribonuclease deficiency. Accordingly, antitermination activity exerted on T$\phi$ by abortive transcripts should facilitate expression of T$\phi$-downstream promoter-less genes 11 and 12 in T7 infection of Escherichia coli.},

We studied the correlation between the {APA} profile and the tumor aggressiveness in cases of lung cancer. We selected the top 10 genes showing significant 3'{UTR} shortening in lung cancer, using the package of the Bioconductor for probe-level analyses of expression microarrays. We established and evaluated the {APA} score by quantitative {RT}-{PCR} in 147 clinical specimens of non-small cell lung cancer and compared the results with the clinical outcomes and expression levels of {APA}-related genes, including {PABPN}1, {CPEB}1, E2F1 and proliferation markers ({MKI}67, {TOP}2A and {MCM}2). High {APA} scores were correlated with an advanced tumor stage and a poor prognosis (P~{\textless}~0.001). Multivariate analysis identified the {APA} score as an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio, 3.0; P~=~0.03). Both lower expression of {PABPN}1 and higher expression of the proliferation markers were correlated with high {APA} scores and a poor prognosis, with suppression of {PABPN}1 exerting its influence independent of gain of the proliferation markers. Moreover, the {APA} score was correlated with the maximum standardized uptake value of the tumors on positron emission tomography (r~=~0.53; P~{\textless}~0.001). Our results indicate that the loss of {PABPN}1, a suppressor of {APA}, might promote tumor aggressiveness by releasing the cancer cells from {microRNA}-mediated gene regulation.},

	abstract = {{RNA} polymerase {II} transcription complexes stalled shortly after initiation over a repetitive segment of the template can undergo efficient transcript slippage, during which the 3' end of the {RNA} slides upstream and then re-pairs with the template, allowing transcription to continue. In the present study, we have used transcript slippage as an assay to identify possible structural transitions that occur as the polymerase passes from the initiation to the elongation phase of transcription. We reasoned that transcript slippage would not occur in fully processive complexes. We constructed a series of templates that allowed us to stall {RNA} polymerase {II} after the synthesis of a repetitive sequence (5'-{CUCUCU}-3') at varying distances downstream of +1. We found that polymerase must synthesize at least a 23-nt {RNA} to attain resistance to transcript slippage. The ability to undergo slippage was lost in two discrete steps, suggestive of two distinct transitions. The first transition is the formation of the 8- to 9-bp mature {RNA}{\textendash}{DNA} hybrid, when slippage abruptly dropped by 10-fold. However, easily detectable slippage continued until 14 more bonds were made. Thus, although the transcript becomes tightly constrained within the transcription complex once the hybrid reaches its final length, much more {RNA} synthesis is required before the {RNA} is no longer able to slip upstream along the template. This last point may reflect an important stabilizing role for the interaction of the polymerase with the transcript well upstream of the {RNA}{\textendash}{DNA} hybrid.},

Two accessory protein complexes were shown to stimulate the exosome in the yeast nucleus. First is the polyadenylation complex called {TRAMP}4 and/or {TRAMP}5 depending on whether it contains the poly(A) polymerase Trf4 or Trf5
{TRAMP} adds short poly(A) tails to aberrant or unstable transcripts, forming a favourable substrate for the exosome

This review addresses both topics by familiarizing readers with key concepts (and terminology) in the construction, validation, and application of deterministic biochemical models, with particular emphasis on a simple enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Networks of coupled ordinary differential equations ({ODEs}) are the natural language for describing enzyme kinetics in a mass action approximation. We illustrate this point by showing how the familiar Briggs-Haldane formulation of Michaelis-Menten kinetics derives from the outer (or quasi-steady-state) solution of a dynamical system of {ODEs} describing a simple reaction under special conditions. We discuss how parameters in the Michaelis-Menten approximation and in the underlying {ODE} network can be estimated from experimental data, with a special emphasis on the origins of uncertainty. Finally, we extrapolate from a simple reaction to complex models of multiprotein biochemical networks. The concepts described in this review, hitherto of interest primarily to practitioners, are likely to become important for a much broader community of cellular and molecular biologists attempting to understand the promise and challenges of {\textquotedblleft}systems biology{\textquotedblright} as applied to biochemical mechanisms.},

This scheme deals explicitly with the problem of {TEC} desynchronization as transcript synthesis proceeds, and develops kinetic modules to permit the various alternative states of the {TECs} (paused states, backtracked states, arrested states, and terminated states) to be introduced one-by-one as needed. In this way, we can set up a comprehensive kinetic model of appropriate complexity to fit the known transcriptional properties of any given {DNA} template and set of experimental conditions, including regulatory cofactors. In the companion article, this modular scheme is successfully used to model kinetic transcription elongation data obtained by bulk-gel electrophoresis quenching procedures and real-time surface plasmon resonance methods from a template of known sequence that contains defined pause, stall, and termination sites.},

These rare stochastic events correspond to the formation or dissociation of entire stems through cooperative base pairing/unpairing transitions. Such a clear separation of time scales in {RNA} dynamics has made it possible to implement coarse grained {RNA} simulations, which predict {RNA} folding and unfolding pathways including kinetically trapped structures on biologically relevant time scales of seconds to minutes. {RNA} folding simulations also enable to predict the formation of pseudoknots, that is, helices interior to loops, which mechanically restrain the relative orientations of other non-nested helices. But beyond static structural constraints, pseudoknots can also strongly affect the folding and unfolding dynamics of {RNA}, as the order by which successive helices are formed and dissociated can lead to topologically blocked transition intermediates. The resulting knotty dynamics can enhance the stability of {RNA} switches, improve the efficacy of co-transcriptional folding pathways and lead to unusual self-assembly properties of {RNA}.},

To investigate these factors more broadly, we examined the half-lives and steady-state abundance of known and predicted E. coli {mRNAs} at single-gene resolution by using two-color fluorescent {DNA} microarrays. An {rRNA}-based strategy for normalization of microarray data was developed to permit quantitation of {mRNA} decay after transcriptional arrest by rifampicin. We found that globally, {mRNA} half-lives were similar in nutrient-rich media and defined media in which the generation time was approximately tripled. A wide range of stabilities was observed for individual {mRNAs} of E. coli, although ?80\% of all {mRNAs} had half-lives between 3 and 8 min. Genes having biologically related metabolic functions were commonly observed to have similar stabilities. Whereas the half-lives of a limited number of {mRNAs} correlated positively with their abundance, we found that overall, increased {mRNA} stability is not predictive of increased abundance. Neither the density of putative sites of cleavage by {RNase} E, which is believed to initiate {mRNA} decay in E. coli, nor the free energy of folding of 5' or 3' untranslated region sequences was predictive of {mRNA} half-life. Our results identify previously unsuspected features of {mRNA} decay at a global level and also indicate that generalizations about decay derived from the study of individual gene transcripts may have limited applicability.},

Here we examine the functional relevance of the {GCCG} motif and determine which residues in $\sigma$28 participate in its recognition. We find that the {GCCG} motif is a functionally important composite element. The upstream {GC} constitutes an extended -10 motif and is recognized by R91, a residue in Domain 3 of $\sigma$28. The downstream {CG} is the upstream edge of -10 region of the promoter; two residues in Region 2.4, D81 and R84, participate in its recognition. Consistent with their role in base-specific recognition of the promoter, R91, D81 and D84 are universally conserved in $\sigma$28 orthologues. $\sigma$28 is the second Group 3 $\sigma$ shown to use an extended -10 region in promoter recognition, raising the possibility that other Group 3 $\sigma$s will do so as well.},

	abstract = {Summary
Recent years have seen intensive progress in measuring protein translation. However, the contributions of coding sequences to the efficiency of the process remain unclear. Here, we identify a universally conserved profile of translation efficiency along {mRNAs} computed based on adaptation between coding sequences and the {tRNA} pool. In this profile, the first \~{}30{\textendash}50 codons are, on average, translated with a low efficiency. Additionally, in eukaryotes, the last \~{}50 codons show the highest efficiency over the full coding sequence. The profile accurately predicts position-dependent ribosomal density along yeast genes. These data suggest that translation speed and, as a consequence, ribosomal density are encoded by coding sequences and the {tRNA} pool. We suggest that the slow {\textquotedblleft}ramp{\textquotedblright} at the beginning of {mRNAs} serves as a late stage of translation initiation, forming an optimal and robust means to reduce ribosomal traffic jams, thus minimizing the cost of protein expression.

(1) Plasmid {pUB}200 containing the $\varrho$r$\varrho$l promoters of phage $\lambda$ was found not to serve as an expression vector for a unchanged human glutathione reductase ({hGR})-encoding {cDNA}. (2) When this {cDNA} was expressed in a two-cistron context using high-copy-number plasmids, recombinant protein was detected in low yield (0.03\% of the total cell protein). (3) Silent mutations were introduced into the triplets coding for the N-terminal amino acids. When screening E. coli colonies transformed with expression plasmids containing {cDNA} mutants, we identified adapted clones that produced {hGR} in up to 70-fold higher yield than the clone containing the unchanged {cDNA}. Sequence analyses of adapted {cDNA} species revealed lower G + C contents in the modified regions, suggesting altered {mRNA} structures. (4) When the adapted {cDNA} sequences were recloned in the vector which had failed to express unchanged {hGR} {cDNA} in step 1, synthesis of recombinant protein was as high as in step 3. This means that the yield of expression for adapted {cDNA} was at least 1000-fold higher than for unchanged {cDNA}. In conclusion, random silent mutations introduced into the translation initiation region of {cDNA} might be a useful technique for designing sequence features which favour gene expression.},

Here, we address the minimal composition of the processive elongation complex in the eukaryotes by developing a method for promoter-independent assembly of functional elongation complex of S. cerevisiae {RNA} polymerase {II} from synthetic {DNA} and {RNA} oligonucleotides.

	abstract = {Sequence-specific pausing of multisubunit {RNA} polymerases ({RNAPs}) represents a rate-limiting step during transcription elongation. Pausing occurs on average every 100 bases of {DNA}. Several models have been proposed to explain pausing, including backtracking of the ternary elongation complex, delay of translocation of the enzyme along {DNA}, or a conformational change in the active site preventing formation of the phosphodiester bond. Here, we performed biochemical characterization of previously-reported pauses of Escherichia coli {RNAP} and found that they are not associated with backtracking or a translocation delay. Instead, the paused complex contains the 3' end of the transcript in the active center and is capable of binding the next cognate {NTP}. However, bond formation occurs much slower in the paused complex compared with its fully-active counterpart. The pausing is dramatically decreased by a substitution of the base encoding the next incoming {NTP} and the base encoding the 3' end of the nascent {RNA}, suggesting that (mis)-alignment of the 3' end of the {RNA} and the incoming {NTP} in the active site is crucial for pausing. These pause sites are conserved between E. coli and Thermus thermophilus {RNAPs}, but are not recognized by Saccharomyces cerevisiae {RNAP} {II}, indicating that prokaryotic {RNAPs} might be more sensitive to the changes in the alignment of the nascent transcript and the substrate {NTP} in the active site.},

Two previously identified {RNase} E sites were placed separately between the coding regions to direct cleavage in this area and produce two secondary transcripts, each containing a single-gene coding region. Novel secondary structures were engineered into the 3prime and 5prime ends of each of the coding regions to protect the transcript from inactivation by endoribonucleases (5prime hairpins) and degradation by exoribonucleases (3prime hairpins). In addition, the effects of relative gene placement were examined by switching the locations of the two coding regions. Depending on the particular secondary structures and {RNase} E sites placed between the genes the relative steady-state transcript and protein levels encoded by the two reporter genes could be changed up to 2.5-fold and 4-fold, respectively.

	abstract = {Summary 
Transcriptional pausing, which regulates transcript elongation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, is thought to involve formation of alternative {RNA} polymerase conformations in which nucleotide addition is inhibited in part by restriction of trigger loop ({TL}) folding. The polymorphous {TL} must convert from a random coil to a helical hairpin that contacts the nucleotide triphosphate ({NTP}) substrate to allow rapid nucleotide addition. Understanding the distribution of {TL} conformations in different enzyme states is made difficult by the {TL}'s small size and sensitive energetics. Here, we report a Cys-pair reporter strategy to elucidate the relative occupancies of different {TL} conformations in E.~coli {RNA} polymerase based on~the ability of Cys residues engineered into the {TL} and surrounding regions to form disulfide bonds. Our results indicate that a paused complex stabilized by a nascent {RNA} hairpin favors nonproductive {TL}~conformations that persist after {NTP} binding but can be reversed by the elongation factor {RfaH}.},

	abstract = {The translational initiation region ({TIR}) of the Escherichia coli {rpsA} gene, which encodes ribosomal protein S1, shows a number of unusual features. It extends far upstream (to position -91) of the initiator {AUG}, it lacks a canonical Shine-Dalgarno sequence ({SD}) element, and it can fold into three successive hairpins (I, {II}, and {III}) that are essential for high translational activity. Two conserved {GGA} trinucleotides, present in the loops of hairpins I and {II}, have been proposed to form a discontinuous {SD}. Here, we have tested this hypothesis with the {\textquotedblleft}specialized ribosome{\textquotedblright} approach. Depending upon the constructs used, translation initiation was decreased three- to sevenfold upon changing the conserved {GGA} to {CCU}. However, although chemical probing showed that the mutated trinucleotides were accessible, no restoration was observed when the ribosome anti-{SD} was symmetrically changed from {CCUCC} to {GGAGG}. When the same change was introduced in the {SD} from a conventional {TIR} as a control, activity was stimulated. This result suggests that the {GGA} trinucleotides do not form a discontinuous {SD}. Others hypotheses that may account for their role are discussed. Curiously, we also find that, when expressed at moderate level (30 to 40\% of total ribosomes), specialized ribosomes are only twofold disadvantaged over normal ribosomes for the translation of bulk cellular {mRNAs}. These findings suggest that, under these conditions, the {SD}-anti-{SD} interaction plays a significant but not essential role for the synthesis of bulk cellular proteins.},

	abstract = {Summary
We perform a genome-wide analysis of the transition between transcriptional initiation and elongation in Escherichia coli by determining the association of core {RNA} polymerase ({RNAP}) and the promoter-recognition factor [sigma]70 with respect to {RNA} transcripts. We identify 1286 [sigma]70-associated promoters, including many internal to known operons, and demonstrate that [sigma]70 is usually released very rapidly from elongating {RNAP} complexes. On average, {RNAP} density is higher at the promoter than in the coding sequence, although the ratio is highly variable among different transcribed regions. Strikingly, a significant fraction of {RNAP}-bound promoters is not associated with transcriptional activity, perhaps due to an intrinsic energetic barrier to promoter escape. Thus, the transition from transcriptional initiation to elongation is highly variable, often rate limiting, and in some cases is essentially blocked such that {RNAP} is effectively "poised" to transcribe only under the appropriate environmental conditions. The genomic pattern of {RNAP} density in E. coli differs from that in yeast and mammalian cells.},

	abstract = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp {DNA} sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the {DNA} of five individuals. Two assembly strategies{\textemdash}a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly{\textemdash}were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90\% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25\% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional \~{}12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the genome being intergenic {DNA}. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. {DNA} sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1\% of all {SNPs} resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which {SNPs} have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

This review addresses both topics by familiarizing readers with key concepts (and terminology) in the construction, validation, and application of deterministic biochemical models, with particular emphasis on a simple enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Networks of coupled ordinary differential equations ({ODEs}) are the natural language for describing enzyme kinetics in a mass action approximation. We illustrate this point by showing how the familiar Briggs-Haldane formulation of Michaelis-Menten kinetics derives from the outer (or quasi-steady-state) solution of a dynamical system of {ODEs} describing a simple reaction under special conditions. We discuss how parameters in the Michaelis-Menten approximation and in the underlying {ODE} network can be estimated from experimental data, with a special emphasis on the origins of uncertainty. Finally, we extrapolate from a simple reaction to complex models of multiprotein biochemical networks. The concepts described in this review, hitherto of interest primarily to practitioners, are likely to become important for a much broader community of cellular and molecular biologists attempting to understand the promise and challenges of {\textquotedblleft}systems biology{\textquotedblright} as applied to biochemical mechanisms.},

To determine the regulation of human Scd, we characterized the gene and its transcripts. Screening a human keratinocyte {cDNA} library and analysis of 3'-{RACE} (rapid amplification of {cDNA} ends) products from various tissues yielded a 5.2 kb {cDNA} encoding a 359 amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 41.5 {kDa}. Analysis of 3'-{RACE} products suggested that alternative usage of polyadenylation sites generates two transcripts of 3.9 and 5.2 kb, a result consistent with Northern analysis. Southern analysis demonstrated the existance of two {SCD} loci in the human genome. Chromosomal mapping localized one locus to chromosome 10, and the second locus to chromosome 17. Characterization of genomic clones isolated from chromosome-specific libraries revealed that only the locus on chromosome 10 contained introns. Sequence analysis of the intron-less locus displayed multiple nucleotide insertions and deletions, as well as in-frame stop codons. Reverse transcriptase-{PCR} analysis performed with primers specific to the intron-less locus failed to produce a {PCR} product from brain, liver and skin {RNA}, indicating that the locus on chromosome 17 is most likely a transcriptionally inactive, fully processed pseudogene. These results suggest strongly that there is one structural {SCD} gene in the human genome, and that it generates two transcripts by use of alternative polyadenyation sites. Although the primary sequence and intron-exon structure of {SCD} is phylogenetically conserved, divergence between rodent and human is seen in the number of {SCD} genes and in the generation of alternative transcripts, suggesting a species-specific component of {SCD} regulation and function.},

Regulation of transcription initiation is generally attributable to activator/repressor proteins that bind to specific {DNA} sequences. However, regulators can also achieve specificity by binding directly to {RNA} polymerase ({RNAP}) and exploiting the kinetic variation intrinsic to different {RNAP}-promoter complexes. We report here a previously unknown interaction with Escherichia coli {RNAP} that defines an additional recognition element in bacterial promoters. The strength of this sequence-specific interaction varies at different promoters and affects the lifetime of the complex with {RNAP}. Selection of {rRNA} promoter mutants forming long-lived complexes, kinetic analyses of duplex and bubble templates, dimethylsulfate footprinting, and zero-Angstrom crosslinking demonstrated that $\sigma$ subunit region 1.2 directly contacts the nontemplate strand base two positions downstream of the -10 element (within the {\textquotedblleft}discriminator{\textquotedblright} region). By making a nonoptimal $\sigma$1.2-discriminator interaction, {rRNA} promoters create the short-lived complex required for specific responses to the {RNAP} binding factors {ppGpp} and {DksA}, ultimately accounting for regulation of ribosome synthesis.},

	abstract = {{RNA} structure has critical roles in processes ranging from ligand sensing to the regulation of translation, polyadenylation and splicing. However, a lack of genome-wide in vivo {RNA} structural data has limited our understanding of how {RNA} structure regulates gene expression in living cells. Here we present a high-throughput, genome-wide in vivo {RNA} structure probing method, structure-seq, in which dimethyl sulphate methylation of unprotected adenines and cytosines is identified by next-generation sequencing. Application of this method to Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings yielded the first in vivo genome-wide {RNA} structure map at nucleotide resolution for any organism, with quantitative structural information across more than 10,000 transcripts. Our analysis reveals a three-nucleotide periodic repeat pattern in the structure of coding regions, as well as a less-structured region immediately upstream of the start codon, and shows that these features are strongly correlated with translation efficiency. We also find patterns of strong and weak secondary structure at sites of alternative polyadenylation, as well as strong secondary structure at 5' splice sites that correlates with unspliced events. Notably, in vivo structures of messenger {RNAs} annotated for stress responses are poorly predicted in silico, whereas {mRNA} structures of genes related to cell function maintenance are well predicted. Global comparison of several structural features between these two categories shows that the {mRNAs} associated with stress responses tend to have more single-strandedness, longer maximal loop length and higher free energy per nucleotide, features that may allow these {RNAs} to undergo conformational changes in response to environmental conditions. Structure-seq allows the {RNA} structurome and its biological roles to be interrogated on a genome-wide scale and should be applicable to any organism.},

Here, {RNA} polymerase repeatedly initiates and aborts transcription, giving rise to a ladder of short {RNAs} 2-11 nucleotides long. Certain mutations in the initial transcribed sequence ({ITS}) of N25 lengthen the abortive initiation program, resulting in the release of very long abortive transcripts ({VLATs}) 16-19 nucleotides long. This phenomenon is completely dependent on sequences within the first 20 bases of the {ITS} since altering sequences downstream of +20 has no effect on their formation. {VLAT} formation also requires strong interactions between {RNA} polymerase and the promoter. Mutations that change the -35 and -10 hexamers and the intervening 17 base pair spacer away from consensus decrease the probability of aborting at positions +16 to +19. An unusual characteristic of the {VLATs} is their undiminished levels in the presence of {GreB}, which rescues abortive {RNAs} (<=15 nucleotides) associated with backtracked initial transcribing complexes. This suggests that {VLATs} are produced via a mechanism distinct from backtracking, which we propose entails polymerase molecules hyper forward translocating during the promoter escape transition. We discuss how certain features in the {ITS}, when combined with the N25 promoter, may lead to hyper forward translocation and abortive release at {VLAT} positions.},

The fact that functional genomics data of different types reflect the same molecular processes provides a natural strategy for integrative computational analysis. One promising avenue toward an accurate and comprehensive model of gene regulation combines biophysical modeling of the interactions among proteins, {DNA}, and {RNA} with the use of large-scale functional genomics data to estimate regulatory network connectivity and activity parameters.

Transcriptional pausing by {RNA} polymerase ({RNAP}) plays an essential role in gene regulation. Pausing is modified by various elongation factors, including prokaryotic {NusA}, but the mechanisms underlying pausing and {NusA} function remain unclear. Alternative models for pausing invoke blockade events that precede translocation (on-pathway), enzyme backtracking (off-pathway), or isomerization to a nonbacktracked, elemental pause state (off-pathway). We employed an optical trapping assay to probe the motions of individual {RNAP} molecules transcribing a {DNA} template carrying tandem repeats encoding the his pause, subjecting these enzymes to controlled forces. {NusA} significantly decreased the pause-free elongation rate of {RNAP} while increasing the probability of entry into short- and long-lifetime pauses, in a manner equivalent to exerting a \~{}19 {pN} force opposing transcription. The effects of force and {NusA} on pause probabilities and lifetimes support a reaction scheme where nonbacktracked, elemental pauses branch off the elongation pathway from the pretranslocated state of {RNAP}.},

The common belief that endonucleolytic cleavage is the initial, rate-determining step of {mRNA} decay in Escherichia coli fails to explain the influence of 5' termini on the half-lives of primary transcripts. We have re-examined the initial events of {RNA} degradation in that organism by devising an assay to probe the 5' phosphorylation state of {RNA} and by employing a self-cleaving hammerhead ribozyme to investigate the degradative consequences of an unphosphorylated 5' end. These studies have identified a previously unrecognized prior step in decay that triggers subsequent internal cleavage by the endonuclease {RNase} E and thereby governs {RNA} longevity: the rate-determining conversion of a triphosphorylated to a monophosphorylated 5' terminus. Our findings redefine the role of {RNase} E in {RNA} degradation and explain how unpaired 5'-terminal nucleotides can facilitate access to internal cleavage sites within primary transcripts.

Deletion of these upstream sequences from {MS}2 {cDNA} plasmids results in a 30-fold reduction of translational efficiency. By site-directed mutagenesis, we show that this low level of expression is caused by a hairpin structure centred around the initiation codon. When this hairpin is destabilized by the introduction of mismatches, expression from the truncated messenger increases 20-fold to almost the level of the full-length construct. Thus, the translational effect of hundreds of upstream nucleotides can be mimicked by a single substitution that destabilizes the structure. The same hairpin is also present in full-length {MS}2 {RNA}, but there it does not Impair ribosome binding. Apparently, the upstream {RNA} somehow reduces the inhibitory effect of the structure on translational initiation. The upstream {MS}2 sequence does not stimulate translation when cloned in front of another gene, nor can unrelated {RNA} segments activate the coat-protein gene. Several possible mechanisms for the activation are discussed and a function in gene regulation of the phage is suggested.},

Gene expression can be regulated at the level of initiation of protein biosynthesis via structural elements present at the 5' untranslated region of {mRNAs}. These folded {mRNA} segments may bind to the ribosome, thus blocking translation until the {mRNA} unfolds. Here, we report a series of cryo-electron microscopy snapshots of ribosomal complexes directly visualizing either the {mRNA} structure blocked by repressor protein S15 or the unfolded, active {mRNA}. In the stalled state, the folded {mRNA} prevents the start codon from reaching the peptidyl-{tRNA} (P) site inside the ribosome. Upon repressor release, the {mRNA} unfolds and moves into the {mRNA} channel allowing translation initiation. A comparative structure and sequence analysis suggests the existence of a universal stand-by site on the ribosome (the 30S platform) dedicated for binding regulatory 5' {mRNA} elements. Different types of {mRNA} structures may be accommodated during translation preinitiation and regulate gene expression by transiently stalling the ribosome.},

	abstract = {We recently reported that a ribosome binding site ({RBS}) derived from gene 10 of bacteriophage T7 (g10-L) causes a pronounced stimulation of expression when placed upstream of a variety of genes, and that this effect is probably due to a stimulation of translation efficiency in Escherichia coli (Olins, P. O., Devine, C. S., Rangwala, S. H., Kavka, K. S. (1988) Gene (Amst.) 73, 227-235). Here we present a model for the mechanism of action of the g10-L: the {RBS} contains a 9-base sequence which has the potential for forming a novel base-paired interaction with bases 458-466 of the 16 S {rRNA} of E. coli. Although such sequence homologies are rare in E. coli {RBS} regions, a number of similar sequences were found in the {RBS} regions of other bacteriophage structural genes. When an isolated homology sequence was placed upstream of a synthetic {RBS}, there was a 110-fold increase in the translation efficiency of the {lacZ} gene. Surprisingly, the homology sequence also stimulated translation when placed downstream of the initiator codon, indicating that this sequence is acting as a translational "enhancer."},

We report here an investigation of a promoter, Pminor, that has a nearly perfect match to the -35 sequence and has the {TGn} motif. However, Pminor contains an extremely poor $\sigma$70 -10 element. We demonstrate that Pminor is active both in vivo and in vitro and that mutations in either the -35 or the {TGn} motif eliminate its activity. Mutation of the {TGn} motif can be compensated for by mutations that make the -10 element more canonical, thus converting the -35/{TGn} promoter to a -35/-10 promoter. Potassium permanganate footprinting on the nontemplate and template strands indicates that when polymerase is in a stable (open) complex with Pminor, the {DNA} is single stranded from positions -11 to +4. We also demonstrate that transcription from Pminor incorporates nontemplated ribonucleoside triphosphates at the 5' end of the Pminor transcript, which results in an anomalous assignment for the start site when primer extension analysis is used. Pminor represents one of the few -35/{TGn} promoters that have been characterized and serves as a model for investigating functional differences between these promoters and the better-characterized -10/-35 and extended -10 promoters used by E. coli {RNA} polymerase.},

	abstract = {Escherichia coli {DksA}, {GreA}, and {GreB} have similar structures and bind to the same location on {RNA} polymerase ({RNAP}), the secondary channel. We show that {GreB} can fulfil some roles of {DksA} in vitro, including shifting the promoter-open complex equilibrium in the dissociation direction, thus allowing {rRNA} promoters to respond to changes in the concentration of {ppGpp} and {NTPs}. However, unlike deletion of the {dksA} gene, deletion of {greB} had no effect on {rRNA} promoters in vivo. We show that the apparent affinities of {DksA} and {GreB} for {RNAP} are similar, but the cellular concentration of {GreB} is much lower than that of {DksA}. When over-expressed and in the absence of competing {GreA}, {GreB} almost completely complemented the loss of {dksA} in control of {rRNA} expression, indicating its inability to regulate {rRNA} transcription in vivo results primarily from its low concentration. In contrast to {GreB}, the apparent affinity of {GreA} for {RNAP} was weaker than that of {DksA}, {GreA} affected {rRNA} promoters only modestly in vitro and, even when over-expressed, {GreA} did not affect {rRNA} transcription in vivo. Thus, binding in the secondary channel is necessary but insufficient to explain the effect of {DksA} on {rRNA} transcription. Neither Gre factor was capable of fulfilling two other functions of {DksA} in transcription initiation: co-activation of amino acid biosynthetic gene promoters with {ppGpp} and compensation for the loss of the $\omega$ subunit of {RNAP} in the response of {rRNA} promoters to {ppGpp}. Our results provide important clues to the mechanisms of both negative and positive control of transcription initiation by {DksA}.},

In vitro, transcript cleavage by {GreA} contributes to transcription efficiency by (i) suppressing pauses and arrests, (ii) stimulating {RNAP} promoter escape, and (iii) enhancing transcription fidelity. However, it is unclear which of these functions is (are) most relevant in vivo. By comparing global gene expression profiles of Escherichia coli strains lacking Gre factors and strains expressing either the wild type (wt) or a functionally inactive {GreA} mutant, we identified genes that are potential targets of {GreA} action. Data analysis revealed that in the presence of chromosomally expressed {GreA}, 19 genes are upregulated; an additional 105 genes are activated upon overexpression of the wt but not the mutant {GreA}. Primer extension reactions with selected transcription units confirmed the gene array data. The most prominent stimulatory effect (threefold to about sixfold) of {GreA} was observed for genes of ribosomal protein operons and the tna operon, suggesting that transcript cleavage by {GreA} contributes to optimal expression levels of these genes in vivo. In vitro transcription assays indicated that the stimulatory effect of {GreA} upon the transcription of these genes is mostly due to increased {RNAP} recycling due to facilitated promoter escape. We propose that transcript cleavage during early stages of initiation is thus the main in vivo function of {GreA}. Surprisingly, the presence of the wt {GreA} also led to the decreased transcription of many genes. The mechanism of this effect is unknown and may be indirect.},

To get further insight into the mechanism of {RNA} priming, we determined the structure of initially transcribing complex of {RNAP} holoenzyme with 6-mer {RNA}, obtained by in crystallo transcription approach. The structure highlights {RNAP}-{RNA} contacts that stabilize the short {RNA} transcript in the active site and demonstrates that the {RNA} 5'-end displaces $\sigma$ region 3.2 from its position near the active site, which likely plays a key role in $\sigma$ ejection during the initiation-to-elongation transition.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Metabolic engineering aims at channeling the metabolic fluxes towards a desired compound. An important strategy to achieve this is the modification of the expression level of specific genes. Several methods for the modification or the replacement of promoters have been proposed, but most of them involve time-consuming screening steps. We describe here a novel optimized method for the insertion of constitutive promoters (referred to as "promoter knock-in") whose strength can be compared with the native promoter by applying a promoter strength predictive ({PSP}) model.{RESULTS}:Our method was successfully applied to fine tune the ppc gene of Escherichia coli. While developing the promoter knock-in methodology, we showed the importance of conserving the natural leader region containing the ribosome binding site ({RBS}) of the gene of interest and of eliminating upstream regulatory elements (transcription factor binding sites). The gene expression was down regulated instead of up regulated when the natural {RBS} was not conserved and when the upstream regulatory elements were eliminated. Next, three different promoter knock-ins were created for the ppc gene selecting three different artificial promoters. The measured constitutive expression of the ppc gene in these knock-ins reflected the relative strength of the different promoters as predicted by the {PSP} model. The applicability of our {PSP} model and promoter knock-in methodology was further demonstrated by showing that the constitutivity and the relative levels of expression were independent of the genetic background (comparing wild-type and mutant E. coli strains). No differences were observed during scaling up from shake flask to bioreactor-scale, confirming that the obtained expression was independent of environmental conditions.{CONCLUSION}:We are proposing a novel methodology for obtaining appropriate levels of expression of genes of interest, based on the prediction of the relative strength of selected synthetic promoters combined with an optimized promoter knock-in strategy. The obtained expression levels are independent of the genetic background and scale conditions. The method constitutes therefore a valuable addition to the genetic toolbox for the metabolic engineering of E. coli.},

During transcript elongation, the sizes of the {DNA} footprint and the single-stranded transcription bubble vary markedly among transcription complexes halted at different template positions. To test whether transcription complex intermediates formed during transcript cleavage-induced reverse translocation also display heterogeneous conformations at different template positions, we examined the structures of two different transcription complexes before and after {GreA} treatment. Transcription complexes halted at position +16 after initiation at the T7 A1 promoter or paused at the {trpL} pause site exhibited strong blocks to transcript cleavage after removal of 6 to 10 nucleotides. In both cases, the down-stream contact between {RNA} polymerase and {DNA} moved little during transcript cleavage, thereby increasing its distance from the active site, whereas the upstream {DNA} contact and the borders of the transcription bubble moved in approximate register with the transcript 3'-end. The backward movements of halted E. coli {RNA} polymerase are similar to a recently postulated model for discontinuous translocation during transcription, but differ from those reported for arrested {RNA} polymerase {II} transcription complexes.},

A restriction fragment bearing only the trp promoter region was mutagenized with nitrous acid, religated to the unmutagenized vector and transfected into E.coli. Several clones which give darker blue plaques on indicator media, suggesting increased $\beta$-galactosidase synthesis, were selected for {DNA} sequencing. One clone has a G{\textrightarrow}A transition on the 3' side of the 'Pribnow box' which results in a constitutive promoter. Two clones have different point mutations (C{\textrightarrow}T and T{\textrightarrow}C) between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and initiation codon which raise expression of $\beta$-galactosidase two-fold. A secondary structure model suggests that the latter two mutations could exert their effect by destabilizing base-pairing of the lac Z coding region with the ribosome binding site ({RBS}), thereby allowing easier access to ribosomes. Support for the model comes from the finding that neither of the {RBS} mutations increase expression of a different downstream gene which forms no obvious secondary structure with the {RBS} region, whether or not the mutations are present. These results strengthen the hypothesis that secondary structure masking is a major determinant of {RBS} strength.},

In this model, {RNA} extension is carried out by a mobile catalytic center that, at certain {DNA} sites, advances within stationary {RNA} polymerase. This idea emerged from the observation that footprints of individual elongation complexes, haltedin vitro at consecutive {DNA} positions, can remain fixed on the template for several contiguous nucleotide additions. Here, we examine in detail the structural transitions that occur immediately after the enzyme stops at sites where discontinuous advancement of {RNA} polymerase is observed. We demonstrate that halting at such special sites does not {\textquotedblleft}freeze{\textquotedblright} {RNA} polymerase at one location but induces it to leave its initial position and to slide backward along the {DNA} and the {RNA} without degrading the transcript. The resulting loss of contact between the {RNA} 3'-hydroxyl and the enzyme{\textquoteright}s catalytic center leads to temporary loss of the catalytic activity. This process is equilibrated with enzyme return to the original location, so that {RNA} polymerase is envisaged as an oscillating object switching between catalytically active and inactive states. The retreated isoform constitutes a principal intermediate in factor-induced endonucleolytic {RNA} cleavage. These oscillations of {RNA} polymerase can explain its apparent discontinuous advancement, which had been interpreted as indicating flexibility within the enzyme.},

The inter- and intramolecular forces between this {RNA} and other small molecules and macromolecules, in addition to other factors in the cell such as {pH}, ionic strength, and temperature, influence the complex dynamics associated with transition of a single stranded {RNA} to its secondary and tertiary structure. Since all of the factors that affect the formation of an {RNAs} 3D structure cannot be determined experimentally, statistically derived potential energy has been used in the prediction of protein structure. In the current work, we evaluate the statistical free energy of various secondary structure motifs, including base-pair stacks, hairpin loops, and internal loops, using their statistical frequency obtained from the comparative analysis of more than 50,000 {RNA} sequences stored in the {RNA} Comparative Analysis Database ({rCAD}) at the Comparative {RNA} Web ({CRW}) Site. Statistical energy was computed from the structural statistics for several datasets. While the statistical energy for a base-pair stack correlates with experimentally derived free energy values, suggesting a Boltzmann-like distribution, variation is observed between different molecules and their location on the phylogenetic tree of life. Our statistical energy values calculated for several structural elements were utilized in the Mfold {RNA}-folding algorithm. The combined statistical energy values for base-pair stacks, hairpins and internal loop flanks result in a significant improvement in the accuracy of secondary structure prediction; the hairpin flanks contribute the most.},

Genome-wide analysis of such polyadenylation signals was missing in fission yeast, even though it is an important model organism. We demonstrate that the canonical {AATAAA} motif is the most frequent and functional polyadenylation signal in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Using analysis of {RNA}-Seq data sets from cells grown under various physiological conditions, we identify 3' {UTRs} for nearly 90\% of the yeast genes. Heterogeneity of cleavage sites is common, as is alternative polyadenylation within and between conditions. We validated the computationally identified sequence elements likely to promote polyadenylation by functional assays, including {qRT}-{PCR} and 3'{RACE} analysis. The biological importance of the {AATAAA} motif is underlined by functional analysis of the genes containing it. Furthermore, it has been shown that convergent genes require trans elements, like cohesin for efficient transcription termination. Here we show that convergent genes lacking cohesin (on chromosome 2) are generally associated with longer overlapping {mRNA} transcripts.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:The fine tuning of two features of the bacterial regulatory machinery have been known to contribute to the diversity of gene expression within the same regulon: the sequence of Transcription Factor ({TF}) binding sites, and their location with respect to promoters. While variations of binding sequences modulate the strength of the interaction between the {TF} and its binding sites, the distance between binding sites and promoters alter the interaction between the {TF} and the {RNA} polymerase ({RNAP}).{RESULTS}:In this paper we estimated the dissociation constants (Kd) of several E. coli {TFs} in their interaction with variants of their binding sequences from the scores resulting from aligning them to Positional Weight Matrices. A correlation coefficient of 0.78 was obtained when pooling together sites for different {TFs}. The theoretically estimated Kd values were then used, together with the dissociation constants of the {RNAP}-promoter interaction to analyze activated and repressed promoters. The strength of repressor sites -- i.e., the strength of the interaction between {TFs} and their binding sites -- is slightly higher than that of activated sites. We explored how different factors such as the variation of binding sequences, the occurrence of more than one binding site, or different {RNAP} concentrations may influence the promoters' response to the variations of {TF} concentrations. We found that the occurrence of several regulatory sites bound by the same {TF} close to a promoter -- if they are bound by the {TF} in an independent manner -- changes the effect of {TF} concentrations on promoter occupancy, with respect to individual sites. We also found that the occupancy of a promoter will never be more than half if the {RNAP} concentration-to-Kp ratio is 1 and the promoter is subject to repression; or less than half if the promoter is subject to activation. If the ratio falls to 0.1, the upper limit of occupancy probability for repressed drops below 10\%; a descent of the limits occurs also for activated promoters.{CONCLUSION}:The number of regulatory sites may thus act as a versatility-producing device, in addition to serving as a source of robustness of the transcription machinery. Furthermore, our results show that the effects of {TF} concentration fluctuations on promoter occupancy are constrained by {RNAP} concentrations.},

	abstract = {{RNA} polymerase {II} ({RNAP} {II}) is responsible for transcribing all messenger {RNAs} in eukaryotic cells during a highly regulated process that is conserved from yeast to human, and that serves as a central control point for cellular function. Here we investigate the transcription dynamics of single {RNAP} {II} molecules from Saccharomyces cerevisiae against force and in the presence and absence of {TFIIS}, a transcription elongation factor known to increase transcription through nucleosomal barriers. Using a single-molecule dual-trap optical-tweezers assay combined with a novel method to enrich for active complexes, we found that the response of {RNAP} {II} to a hindering force is entirely determined by enzyme backtracking. Surprisingly, {RNAP} {II} molecules ceased to transcribe and were unable to recover from backtracks at a force of 7.5 2 {pN}, only one-third of the force determined for Escherichia coli {RNAP}. We show that backtrack pause durations follow a t-3/2 power law, implying that during backtracking {RNAP} {II} diffuses in discrete base-pair steps, and indicating that backtracks may account for most of {RNAP} {II} pauses. Significantly, addition of {TFIIS} rescued backtracked enzymes and allowed transcription to proceed up to a force of 16.9 3.4 {pN}. Taken together, these results describe a regulatory mechanism of transcription elongation in eukaryotes by which transcription factors modify the mechanical performance of {RNAP} {II}, allowing it to operate against higher loads.},

	abstract = {Pyrimidine-mediated regulation of {pyrBI} operon expression in Escherichia coli K-12 occurs through {UTP}-sensitive transcriptional attenuation and through a second mechanism that functions at the level of transcriptional initiation. In this study we demonstrate that this second control mechanism is based on {UTP}-sensitive reiterative {RNA} synthesis within a run of three T-A base pairs in the {pyrBI} initially transcribed region. Our results show that high {UTP} levels induce the synthesis in vitro of nascent transcripts with the sequence {AAUUUUn} (where n = 1 to {\textgreater} 30), which are not extended downstream to include {pyrBI} sequences. Synthesis of these transcripts, which are initiated at the predominant in vivo transcriptional start site, inhibits the production of full-length {pyrBI} transcripts. A {TTT} to {GTA} mutation in the {pyrBI} initially transcribed region eliminates reiterative transcription and stimulates productive transcription in vitro. When introduced into the E. coli chromosome, this mutation causes a sevenfold increase in {pyrBI} expression in cells grown under conditions of pyrimidine excess and nearly abolishes pyrimidine-mediated regulation of {pyrBI} expression when coupled with a mutation that eliminates attenuation control. Additional experiments indicate that the context of the three T-A base pairs within the {pyrBI} initially transcribed region is important for reiterative transcription. A possible mechanism for reiterative transcription and the likely involvement of this process in the regulation of other genes are discussed.},

	abstract = {In this paper the values of three free energy parameters governing the superhelical strand separation transition are determined by analysis of available experimental data. These are the free energy, a, needed to initiate a run of separation, the torsional stiffness, C, associated with interstrand winding of the two single strands comprising a separated site and the coefficient, K, of the quadratic free energy associated to residual linking. The experimental data used in this analysis are the locations and relative amounts of strand separation occurring in the {pBR}322 {DNA} molecule and the measured residual linking, both evaluated over a range of negative linking differences. The analytic method used treats strand separation as a heteropolymeric, co-operative, two-state transition to a torsionally deformable alternative conformation, which takes place in a circular {DNA} molecule constrained by the constancy of its linking number. The values determined for these parameters under the experimental conditions (T = 310 K, {pH} = 7.0, monovalent cation concentration = 0.01 m) are a = 10.84({\textpm}0.2) kcal/mol, C = 2.5({\textpm} 0.3) {\texttimes} 10-13 erg/rad2 and K = 2350({\textpm}80) {RT}/N, where N is the molecular length in base-pairs.

In order to assess the accuracy of the author's theoretical methods, these free energy parameters are incorporated into the analysis of superhelical strand separation in different molecules and under other conditions than those used in their evaluation. First, the temperature dependence of transition is treated, then superhelical strand separation is analyzed in a series of {DNA} molecules having systematic sequence modifications, and the results of these theoretical analyses are compared with those from experiments. In all molecules, transition is predicted in the range of linking differences where it is seen experimentally. Moreover, it occurs at the specific sequence locations that the analysis predicts, and with approximately the predicted relative amounts of transition at each location. The known sensitivities of this transition to changes of temperature and to small sequence modifications are predicted in a quantitatively precise manner by the theoretical results. The demonstrated high-level precision of these theoretical methods provides a tool for the screening of {DNA} sequences for sites susceptible to superhelical strand separation, some of which may have regulatory or other biological significance.},

Current models of elongation suggest that the enzyme backtracks at these locations, but the dynamics are unresolved. Here, we study the role of lateral displacement in pausing and arrest by applying force to individually transcribing molecules. We find that an assisting mechanical force does not alter the translocation rate of the enzyme, but does reduce the efficiency of both pausing and arrest. Moreover, arrested molecules cannot be rescued by force, suggesting that arrest occurs by a bipartite mechanism: the enzyme backtracks along the {DNA} followed by a conformational change of the ternary complex ({RNA} polymerase, {DNA} and transcript), which cannot be reversed mechanically.},

Using human interleukin 10 ({huIL}-10) and interferon $\alpha$ ({huIFN}-$\alpha$) coding sequences, we systematically analyzed the influence of several major factors on expression of human protein in E. coli. The results from {huIL}-10 and reinforced by {huIFN}-$\alpha$ showed that exposing {AUG} initiator codon from base-paired structure within {mRNA} itself significantly improved the translation of target protein, which resulted in a 10-fold higher protein expression than the wild-type genes. It was also noted that translation process was not affected by the retained short-range stem{\textendash}loop structure at Shine{\textendash}Dalgarno ({SD}) sequences. On the other hand, codon-optimized constructs of {huIL}-10 showed unimproved levels of protein expression, on the contrary, led to a remarkable {RNA} degradation. Our study demonstrates that exposure of {AUG} initiator codon from long-range intra-strand secondary structure at 5'-end of {mRNA} may be used as a general strategy for human protein production in E. coli.},

When added to reactions just before this step, {TFIIE} and {TFIIH} overcame the requirement for negative superhelicity. The positions at which both steps occur were strictly dependent on {RNA} length as opposed to the location of the polymerase relative to promoter elements, showing that the transcript itself controls transformations during promoter escape. We propose a model in which completion of promoter escape involves a rate-limiting conversion of early transcribing complexes into elongation complexes. This transformation is triggered by synthesis of an 8 nt {RNA}, occurs independent of the general transcription factors, and requires under-winding in the {DNA} template via negative superhelicity or the action of {TFIIE} and {TFIIH}.},

Chem. 67 (1997) pp. 263{\textendash}267] is further developed to illustrate the relationship between the external load on an individual motor protein in aqueous solution with various {ATP} concentrations and its steady-state velocity. A wide variety of dynamic motor behavior are obtained from this simple model. For the particular case of free-load translocation being the most unfavorable step within the hydrolysis cycle, the load{\textendash}velocity curve is quasi-linear, v/vmax={cF}/Fmax-c/1-c, in contrast to the hyperbolic relationship proposed by A.V. Hill for macroscopic muscle. Significant deviation from the linearity is expected when the velocity is less than 10\% of its maximal (free-load) value {\textemdash} a situation under which the processivity of motor diminishes and experimental observations are less certain. We then investigate the dependence of load{\textendash}velocity curve on {ATP} ({ADP}) concentration. It is shown that the free load vmax exhibits a Michaelis{\textendash}Menten like behavior, and the isometric Fmax increases linearly with ln([{ATP}]/[{ADP}]). However, the quasi-linear region is independent of the {ATP} concentration, yielding an apparently {ATP}-independent maximal force below the true isometric force. Finally, the heat production as a function of {ATP} concentration and external load are calculated. In simple terms and solved with elementary algebra, the present model provides an integrated picture of biochemical kinetics and mechanical energetics of motor proteins.},

	abstract = {Reiterative transcription is the repetitive addition of nucleotides to the 3' end of a nascent transcript due to slippage between the transcript and {DNA} template. Recently, we showed that pyrimidine-mediated regulation {ofpyrBIoperon} expression {inEscherichia} colioccurs, in part, through a mechanism in which induction of {UTP}-dependent reiterative transcription within the initially transcribed region prevents downstream extension of the nascent transcript to include structural gene sequences. In this study we demonstrate that pyrimidine-mediated regulation {ofcodBAoperon} expression {inE}. colialso involves {UTP}-dependent reiterative transcription during initiation; however, the mechanism is different from that of {thepyrBIoperon}. The initially transcribed region of {thecodBApromoter} contains the sequence {GATTTTTTG} (non-template strand). Our results show that transcription is initiated primarily at the first two bases designated G7 and A8 (counting from the -10 region). When transcripts are initiated at position A8, {UTP}-dependent reiterative transcription always occurs within the run of T residues in the initially transcribed region. The {AUUUUn}(wheren=1 to {\textgreater}15) transcripts produced by this reaction are not extended productively to include {downstreamcodBAsequences}. In contrast, most transcripts initiated at position G7 do not engage in reiterative transcription and can be elongated normally. Characterization of {acodBApromoter} mutation that prevents reiterative transcription showed that this reaction is required for virtually all pyrimidine-mediated regulation of operon expression and that {UTP} levels control the selection of the G7 and A8 transcriptional start sites. These results suggest a model for regulation in which high intracellular levels of {UTP} favor transcriptional initiation at position A8 and thus the accompanying reiterative transcription, which together preclude initiation at position G7. Low levels of {UTP} inhibit initiation at position A8 and the associated reiterative transcription, thereby allowing high levels of initiation at position G7 and operon expression. Our results also indicate critical sequence requirements for reiterative transcription, which are important for understanding the mechanism of this reaction as well as for identifying other promoters at which this reaction may occur. Of particular interest is the indication that an {RNA} : {DNA} hybrid forms during transcriptional initiation and the strength of this hybrid controls the extent of reiterative transcription.},

This provides direct evidence for selection on silent sites in those three distantly related multicellular eukaryotes. Surprisingly, there is a strong negative correlation between codon usage and protein length. This effect is not due to a smaller size of highly expressed proteins. Thus, for a same-expression pattern, the selective pressure on codon usage appears to be lower in genes encoding long rather than short proteins. This puzzling observation is not predicted by any of the current models of selection on codon usage and thus raises the question of how translation efficiency affects fitness in multicellular organisms.},

	abstract = {A general mechanism for polymerase translocation is elaborated. The central feature of this mechanism is that a rapid translocational equilibrium is established after each cycle of nucleoside monophosphate incorporation such that the polymerase distributes itself by diffusional sliding between all accessible positions on the template with relative occupancy determined by relative free energy. While alternative models for translocation have not been fully developed, much of the language currently used to describe this step suggests an active mechanism coupled to conformational transitions in the polymerase. For example, a recent study of force generation by Escherichia coli {RNA} polymerase during transcription suggests that it is a mechanoenzyme analogous to kinesin of myosin motor proteins. While the proposed mechanism does not rule out conformational transitions during polymerase translocation, it suggests that they may be unnecessary and that translocation can be explained in terms of the affinity of the active site for nucleoside triphosphate and the relative free energies of the polymerase bound at different positions on the template. This mechanism makes specific predictions which are borne out experimentally with polymerases as distinct as E. coli {DNAP} I, phage T7 {RNAP}, and E. coli {RNAP}.},

	abstract = {The advancement in Escherichia coli genome research has made the information regarding transcription start sites of many genes available. A study relying on the availability of transcription start locations was performed. The first question addressed was what an average {DNA} curvature profile upstream of genes would look like when these genes are aligned by transcription start sites in comparison to alignment by translation start sites. Since it was hypothesized that curvature plays a role in transcription regulation, the expectation was that curvature measurements relative to transcription starts, rather than translation, should strengthen the signal. Our study justified this expectation. The second question aimed to clarify the relation between {DNA} curvature and promoter strength. Through clustering based on {DNA} curvature profiles along promoter regions, a strong positive correlation between the promoter strength and the curved {DNA} was found. The third question dealt with dinucleotide periodicity in E. coli to see whether a periodicity pattern specific to promoter regions exists. Such unknown pattern might shed new light on transcription regulation mechanisms in E. coli. A sequence periodicity of about 11 bp is characteristic to the whole E. coli genome, and is especially well-expressed in intergenic regions. Here it was shown that regions of the size of about 100-150 bp centered 70-100 bp upstream to transcription starts carry hidden periodicity with a period of about 10.3 bp.},

A reduced probability of transcript abortion at {RNA} lengths of 6 and 7 nucleotides and a lower ratio of abortive to productive initiation events was observed for some discontinuous templates, consistent with models attributing abortive initiation to the accumulation of strain in the initiating complex. The effect of {DNA} discontinuity on abortion of shorter {RNA} transcripts (2{\textendash}3 nucleotides) was less pronounced; abortion at these short chain lengths may primarily be attributed to the low stability of the {RNA}-{DNA} hybrid. Certain discontinuities had significant effects on the intrinsic catalytic capacity of the open complex and also on the partitioning between productive and unproductive complexes, suggesting that subtle changes in the conformation of the open complex can profoundly affect its function. The rate and efficiency of promoter escape were not correlated with the stability of the open promoter complex despite previous suggestions to the contrary. We conclude that the stability of the open promoter complex is only one of several factors that contribute to the overall rate of promoter escape.},

Class {II} pauses, which may predominate in eukaryotes, cause {RNA} polymerase to slide backwards along {DNA} and {RNA} and to occlude the active site with nascent {RNA}. These pauses differ in their responses to antisense oligonucleotides, pyrophosphate, {GreA}, and general elongation factors {NusA} and {NusG}.

In eukaryotes, stable poly(A)-tails, important for {mRNA} stability and translation initiation, are added to the 3' ends of most nuclear-encoded {mRNAs}, but not to {rRNAs}. Contrarily, in prokaryotes and organelles, polyadenylation stimulates {RNA} degradation. Recently, polyadenylation of nuclear-encoded transcripts in yeast was reported to promote {RNA} degradation, demonstrating that polyadenylation can play a double-edged role for {RNA} of nuclear origin. Here we asked whether in human cells ribosomal {RNA} can undergo polyadenylation. Using both molecular and bioinformatic approaches, we detected non-abundant polyadenylated transcripts of the 18S and 28S {rRNAs}. Interestingly, many of the post-transcriptionally added tails were composed of heteropolymeric poly(A)-rich sequences containing the other nucleotides in addition to adenosine. These polyadenylated {RNA} fragments are most likely degradation intermediates, as primer extension ({PE}) analysis revealed the presence of distal fragmented molecules, some of which matched the polyadenylation sites of the proximal cleavage products revealed by oligo({dT}) and circled {RT}{\textendash}{PCR}. These results suggest the presence of a mechanism to degrade ribosomal {RNAs} in human cells, that possibly initiates with endonucleolytic cleavages and involves the addition of poly(A) or poly(A)-rich tails to truncated transcripts, similar to that which operates in prokaryotes and organelles.},

	abstract = {Translation initiation requires the precise positioning of a ribosome at the start codon. The major signals of bacterial {mRNA} that direct the ribosome to a translational start site are the Shine-Dalgarno ({SD}) sequence within the untranslated leader and the start codon. Evidence for the presence of many non-{SD}-led genes in prokaryotes provides a motive for studying additional interactions between ribosomes and {mRNA} that contribute to translation initiation. A high incidence of adenines has been reported downstream of the start codon for many Escherichia coli genes, and addition of downstream adenine-rich sequences increases expression from several genes in E. coli. Here we describe site-directed mutagenesis of the E. coli {aroL}, {pncB}, and {cysJ} coding sequences that was used to assess the contribution of naturally occurring adenines to in vivo expression and in vitro ribosome binding from {mRNAs} with different {SD}-containing untranslated leaders. Base substitutions that decreased the downstream adenines by one or two nucleotides decreased expression significantly from {aroL}-, {pncB}-, and {cysJ}-{lacZ} fusions; mutations that increased downstream adenines by one or two nucleotides increased expression significantly from {aroL}- and {cysJ}-{lacZ} fusions. Using primer extension inhibition (toeprint) and filter binding assays to measure ribosome binding, the changes in in vivo expression correlated closely with changes in in vitro ribosome binding strength. Our data are consistent with a model in which downstream adenines influence expression through their effects on the {mRNA}-ribosome association rate and the amount of ternary complex formed. This work provides evidence that adenine-rich sequence motifs might serve as a general enhancer of E. coli translation.},

The rate of synonymous substitution between E.coli and Salmonella typhimurium is substantially reduced near the start of the gene, which suggests the presence of an additional selection pressure which competes with the selection for codons which are most rapidly translated. Possible competing sources of selection are the presence of secondary ribosome binding sites downstream from the start codon, the avoidance of {mRNA} secondary structure near the start of the gene and the use of sub-optimal codons to regulate gene expression. We provide evidence against the last of these possibilities. We also show that there is a decrease in the frequency of A, and an increase in the frequency of G along the E.coli genes at all three codon positions.

Most Rho-dependent terminators have been found in enteric bacteria, but they also occur in Gram-positive bacteria and may be widespread among bacteria. Rho-dependent termination requires both cis-acting elements, on the {mRNA}, and trans-acting factors. The only cis-acting element common to Rho-dependent terminators is richness in {rC} residues. Additional sequence elements have been observed at different Rho termination sites. These {\textquoteleft}auxiliary elements' may assist in the termination process; they differ among terminators, their occurrence possibly depending on the function and sequence context of the terminator. Specific nucleotides required for termination have also been identified at Rho sites. Rho is the main factor required for termination; it is a ring-shaped hexameric protein with {ATPase} and helicase activities. {NusG}, {NusA} and {NusB} are additional factors participating in the termination process. Rho-dependent termination occurs by binding of Rho to ribosome-free {mRNA}, C-rich sites being good candidates for binding. Rho's {ATPase} is activated by Rho{\textendash}{mRNA} binding, and provides the energy for Rho translocation along the {mRNA}; translocation requires sliding of the message into the central hole of the hexamer. When a polymerase pause site is encountered, the actual termination occurs, and the transcript is released by Rho's helicase activity. Many aspects of this process are still being studied. The isolation of mutants suppressing termination, site-directed mutagenesis of cis-acting elements in Rho-dependent termination, and biochemistry, are and will be contributing to unravelling the still undefined aspects of the Rho termination machinery. Analysis of the more sophisticated regulatory mechanisms relying on Rho-dependent termination may be crucial in identifying new essential elements for termination.},

To elucidate the functional role of basic patch, mutant Gre proteins were engineered in which the size and charge distribution of basic patch were modified and characterized biochemically. We found that Gre mutants lacking basic patch or carrying basic patch of decreased size bind to {RNA} polymerase and induce transcript cleavage reaction in minimally backtracked ternary elongation complex ({TEC}) with the same efficiency as the wild type factors. However, they exhibit substantially lower readthrough and cleavage activities toward extensively backtracked and arrested {TECs} and display decreased efficiency of photocross-linking to the {RNA} 3'-terminus. Unlike wild type factors, basic patch-less Gre mutants are unable to complement the thermosensitive phenotype of {GreA}{\textendash}:{GreB}{\textendash} E. coli strain. The large basic patch is required but not sufficient for the induction of {GreB}-type cleavage reaction and for the cleavage of arrested {TECs}. Our results demonstrate that the basic patch residues are not directly involved in the induction of transcript cleavage reaction and suggest that the primary role of basic patch is to anchor the nascent {RNA} in {TEC}.

The bacterial {RNAP} functions as a molecular isomerization machine, using binding free energy to remodel the initial recognition complex, placing downstream duplex {DNA} in the active site cleft and then separating the nontemplate and template strands in the region surrounding the start site of {RNA} synthesis. In this initial unstable {\textquotedblleft}open{\textquotedblright} complex the template strand appears correctly positioned in the active site. Subsequently, the nontemplate strand is repositioned and a clamp is assembled on duplex {DNA} downstream of the open region to form the highly stable open complex, {RPo}.

The calculations involve no adjustable parameters except for a cutoff used to discriminate paused from nonpaused complexes. When applied to 100 experimental pauses in transcription elongation by Escherichia coli {RNA} polymerase on 10 {DNA} templates, the approach produces statistically significant results. We also present a kinetic model for the rate of recovery of backtracked paused complexes. A crucial ingredient of our model is the incorporation of kinetic barriers to backtracking resulting from steric clashes of {EC} with the cotranscriptionally generated {RNA} secondary structure, an aspect not included explicitly in previous attempts at modeling the transcription elongation process.},

The relationship between this Shine-Dalgarno ({SD}) region and the binding of ribosomes to translation start-points has been well studied, but a unified mathematical connection between the {SD}, the initiation codon and the spacing between them has been lacking. Using information theory, we constructed a model that treats these three components uniformly by assigning to the {SD} and the initiation region ({IR}) conservations in bits of information, and by assigning to the spacing an uncertainty, also in bits. To build the model, we first aligned the {SD} region by maximizing the information content there. The ease of this process confirmed the existence of the {SD} pattern within a set of 4122 reviewed and revised Escherichia coli gene starts. This large data set allowed us to show graphically, by sequence logos, that the spacing between the {SD} and the initiation region affects both the {SD} site conservation and its pattern. We used the aligned {SD}, the spacing, and the initiation region to model ribosome binding and to identify gene starts that do not conform to the ribosome binding site model. A total of 569 experimentally proven starts are more conserved (have higher information content) than the full set of revised starts, which probably reflects an experimental bias against the detection of gene products that have inefficient ribosome binding sites. Models were refined cyclically by removing non-conforming weak sites. After this procedure, models derived from either the original or the revised gene start annotation were similar. Therefore, this information theory-based technique provides a method for easily constructing biologically sensible ribosome binding site models. Such models should be useful for refining gene-start predictions of any sequenced bacterial genome.},

The products resulting from phosphodiester bond formation, {pppApU} and {PPi}, dissociated rapidly in the absence of the other triphosphates required for {RNA} synthesis. The resulting steady state conversion of {ATP} and {UTP} into {pppApU} was the basis for the new assay. The rate-limiting step in the initiation reaction was not precisely determined, but it was argued not to be entirely the release of product. The Zn2+ chelator, 1,10-phenanthroline, was partially characterized and found to be an uncompetitive inhibitor of {ATP} in the reaction (Ki = 100 micrometer). The unique advantage of this steady state assay is that several steps in the {RNA} initiation process are amplified kinetically and thus can be examined separately with techniques applicable to any other two-substrate, two-product enzyme reaction.},

Most antisense {RNAs} in bacteria inhibit translation by competing with ribosomes for translation initiation regions ({TIRs}) on nascent {mRNA}. We propose a mechanism by which an antisense {RNA} inhibits translation without binding directly to a {TIR}. The {tisAB} locus encodes an {SOS}-induced toxin, and {IstR}-1 is the antisense {RNA} that counteracts toxicity. We show that full-length {tisAB} {mRNA} (+1) is translationally inactive and endonucleolytic processing produces an active {mRNA} (+42). {IstR}-1 binding inhibits translation of this {mRNA}, and subsequent {RNase} {III} cleavage generates a truncated, inactive {mRNA} (+106). In vitro translation, toeprinting, and structure mapping suggest that active, but not inactive, {tisAB} {mRNAs} contain an upstream ribosome loading or "standby" site. Standby binding is required for initiation at the highly structured {tisB} {TIR}. This may involve ribosome sliding to a transiently open {tisB} {TIR}. {IstR}-1 competes with ribosomes by base pairing to the standby site located {\textasciitilde}100 nucleotides upstream.},

	abstract = {Bacterial transcription elongation factors {GreA} and {GreB} stimulate the intrinsic {RNase} activity of {RNA} polymerase ({RNAP}), thus helping the enzyme to read through pausing and arresting sites on {DNA}. Gre factors also accelerate {RNAP} transition from initiation to elongation. Here, we characterized the molecular mechanism by which Gre factors facilitate transcription at two promoters, P and P, that require {GreA} for optimal activity. Using transcription assays, {KMnO} footprinting, and Fe-induced hydroxyl radical mapping, we show that during transcription initiation at P and P in the absence of Gre factors, {RNAP} falls into a condition of promoter-proximal transcriptional arrest that prevents production of full-length transcripts both and . Arrest occurs when {RNAP} synthesizes 9{\textendash}14-nucleotide-long transcripts and backtracks by 5{\textendash}7 (P) or 2{\textendash}4 (P) nucleotides. Initiation factor $\sigma$ contributes to the formation of arrested complexes at both promoters. The signal for promoter-proximal arrest at P is bipartite and requires two elements: the extended -10 promoter element and the initial transcribed region from positions +2 to +6. {GreA} and {GreB} prevent arrest at P and P by inducing cleavage of the 3'-proximal backtracked portion of {RNA} at the onset of arrested complex formation and stimulate productive transcription by allowing {RNAP} to elongate the 5'-proximal transcript cleavage products in the presence of substrates. We propose that promoter-proximal arrest is a common feature of many bacterial promoters and may represent an important physiological target of regulation by transcript cleavage factors.},

	abstract = {Summary
We have studied promoter clearance at a series of {RNA} polymerase {II} promoters with varying spacing of the {TATA} box and start site. We find that regardless of promoter spacing, the upstream edge of the transcription bubble forms 20 bp from {TATA}. The bubble expands downstream until 18 bases are unwound and the {RNA} is at least 7 nt long, at which point the upstream \~{}8 bases of the bubble abruptly reanneal (bubble collapse). If either bubble size or transcript length is insufficient, bubble collapse cannot occur. Bubble collapse coincides with the end of the requirement for the {TFIIH} helicase for efficient transcript elongation. We also provide evidence that bubble collapse suppresses pausing at +7 to +9 caused by the presence of the B finger segment of {TFIIB} within the complex. Our results indicate that bubble collapse defines the {RNA} polymerase {II} promoter clearance transition.},

	abstract = {It has long been known that during initial transcription of the first 8{\textendash}10 bases of {RNA}, complexes are relatively unstable, leading to the release of short abortive {RNA} transcripts. An early {\textquotedblleft}stressed intermediate{\textquotedblright} model led to a more specific mechanistic model proposing {\textquotedblleft}scrunching{\textquotedblright} stress as the basis for the instability. Recent studies in the single subunit T7 {RNA} polymerase have argued against scrunching as the energetic driving force and instead argue for a model in which pushing of the {RNA}-{DNA} hybrid against a protein element associated with promoter binding, while likely driving promoter release, reciprocally leads to instability of the hybrid. In this study, we test these models in the structurally unrelated multisubunit bacterial {RNA} polymerase. Via the targeted introduction of mismatches and nicks in the {DNA}, we demonstrate that neither downstream bubble collapse nor compaction/scrunching of either the single-stranded template or nontemplate strands is a major force driving abortive instability (although collapse from the downstream end of the bubble does contribute significantly to the instability of artificially halted complexes). In contrast, pushing of the hybrid against a mobile protein element ($\sigma$3.2 in the bacterial enzyme) results in substantially increased abortive instability and is likely the primary energetic contributor to abortive cycling. The results suggest that abortive instability is a by-product of the mechanistic need to couple the energy of nucleotide addition ({RNA} chain growth) to driving the timed release of promoter contacts during initial transcription.},

	abstract = {Polyadenylation of {mRNA} in human mitochondria is crucial for gene expression and perturbation of poly(A) tail length has been linked to a human neurodegenerative disease. Here we show that 2'-phosphodiesterase (2'-{PDE}), (hereafter {PDE}12), is a mitochondrial protein that specifically removes poly(A) extensions from mitochondrial {mRNAs} both in vitro and in mitochondria of cultured cells. In eukaryotes, poly(A) tails generally stabilize mature {mRNAs}, whereas in bacteria they increase {mRNA} turnover. In human mitochondria, the effects of increased {PDE}12 expression were transcript dependent. An excess of {PDE}12 led to an increase in the level of three mt-{mRNAs} ({ND}1, {ND}2 and {CytB}) and two ({CO}1 and {CO}2) were less abundant than in mitochondria of control cells and there was no appreciable effect on the steady-state level of the remainder of the mitochondrial transcripts. The alterations in poly(A) tail length accompanying elevated {PDE}12 expression were associated with severe inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis, and consequently respiratory incompetence. Therefore, we propose that {mRNA} poly(A) tails are important in regulating protein synthesis in human mitochondria, as it is the case for nuclear-encoded eukaryotic {mRNA}.},
